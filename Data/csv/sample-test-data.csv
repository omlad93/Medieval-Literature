Fragment
"Doubtful it [broil] stood As two spent swimmers, that do cling together And choke their art. "
"Worthy to be a rebel, for to that The multiplying villanies of nature Do swarm upon him"
"And Fortune, on his damned quarry smiling, Show'd like a rebel's whore"
"Disdaining Fortune, with his brandish'd steel, Which smoked with bloody execution, "
Like Valour's minion carved out his passage Till he faced the slave
"Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,"
"As whence the sun 'gins his reflection, Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders, So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come Discomfort swells"
"No sooner justice had, with valour arm'd, Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,"
"with furbished arms and new supplies of men, Began a fresh assault."
"Dismayed not this [assault] our captains, Macbeth and Banquo? As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion."
