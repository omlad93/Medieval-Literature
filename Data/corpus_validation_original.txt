A YORK-SHIRE Tragedy,
Not so New, as Lamentable and True.
Enter Oliver and Raphe, two Serving-men.
Oliver.
SIrra Raphe, my young Mistris is in such a pittifull passionate humour for the long absence
of her Love.
Raphe.
Why can you blame her, why, Apples hanging longer on the tree then when they are ripe,
makes so many falling, viz.
Mad wenches because they are
not gathered in time, are fain to drop of themselves, and
then 'tis common you know for every man to take them
up.
Oliver.
Masse thou saist true, 'tis common indeed, but
sirrah, is neither our young Master returned, nor our fellow Sam come from London?
Raphe.
Neither of either, as the Puritan Bawd sayes.
'Slid I hear Sam, Sam's come, here tarry, come ifaith,
now my nose itches for news.
Oliv.
And so doth mine elbow.
Sam calls within.
Where are you there?
Sam.
Boy, look you walk my horse with discretion,
I have rid him simply, I warrant his skin sticks to his
back with very heat, if he should catch cold and get the
cough of the lungs, I were well served, were I not?
What
Raph and Oliver.
Am.
Honest fellow Sam, welcome ifaith, what tricks
hast thou brought from London?
Furnisht with things from London.
Sam.
You see I am hang'd after the truest fashion,
three Hats, and two Glasses bobbing upon them, two rebato wyers upon my brest, a Capcase by my side, a Brush
at my back, an Almanack in my pocket, and three Ballats in my codpiece, nay I am the true picture of a common servingman.
Oliv.
I'le swear thou art, thou maist set up when thou
wilt, there's many a one begins with lesse I can tell thee,
that proves a rich man ere he dies, but what's the news
from London, Sam?
Raph.
I that's well sed, what is the news from London,
sirrah.
My young Mistris keeps such a puling for her
Love.
Sam.
Why the more fool she, I, the more ninny-hammer she.
Oliv.
Why Sam, why?
Sam.
Why, he is married to another, long ago.
Amb.
Faith ye jest.
Sam.
Why, did you not know that till now?
Why
he's married, beats his wife, and has two or three children by her: for you must note, that any woman bears
the more when she is beaten.
Raphe.
I that's true, for she bears the blows.
Oliv.
Sirrah Sam, I would not for two years wages
my young Mistris knew so much, she'd run upon the left
hand of her wit, and nere be her own woman again.
Sam.
And I think she was blest in her Cradle, that
he never came in her bed, why he has consumed all,
pawn'd his Lands, and made his University Brother
stand in wax for him; There's a fine phrase for a Scrivener, puh, he ows more then his skin is worth.
Oliver.
Is't possible?
Sam.
Nay, I'le tell you moreover, he calls his Wife
whore, as familiarly as one would call Moll and Doll, and
children bastards, as naturally as can be, but what have
we here?
I thought 'twas something pull'd down my
Breeches: I quite forgot my two poting sticks, these came
from London, now any thing is good here that comes from
London.
Oliver.I, far fetcht you know.
Sam.
But speak in your conscience ifaith, have not we
as good poting sticks i'th' Country as need to be put i'th
fire, the mind of a thing is all, and as thou said'st even
now, far fetcht are the best things far Ladies.
Oliv.
I, and for waiting gentlewomen too.
Sam.
But Raphe, is our beer sower this thunder?
Raph.
No, no, it holds countenance yet.
Sam.
Why then follow me, I'le teach you the finest
humour to be drunk in, I learn'd it at London last week.
Amb.
Faith let's hear it, let's hear it.
Sam.
The bravest humour, 'twould do a man good to
be drunk in it, they call it knighting in London, when
they drink upon their knees.
Amb.
Faith that's excellent.
Come follow me, I'le give you all the degrees of it in order.Exeunt.
Enter Wife.
Wife.
What will become of us?
all will away,
My husband never ceases in expence,
Both to consume his credit and his house.
And 'tis set down by heavens just decree,
That Riots child must needs be beggery.
Are these the vertues that his youth did promise?
Dice and voluptuous meetings, midnight Revels,
Taking his bed with surfets.
Ill beseeming
The ancient honour of his House and Name:
And this not all, but that which kills me most,
When he recounts his losses and false fortunes,
The weaknesse of his state so much dejected,
Not as a man repentant, but half mad,
His fortunes cannot answer his expence:
He sits and sullenly locks up his armes,
Forgetting heaven, looks downward, which makes
Him appear so dreadfull, that he frights my heart:
Walks heavily, as if his soule were earth;
Not penitent for those his sins are past,
But vext, his money cannot make them last:
A fearfull melancholy, ungodly sorrow.
Oh yonder he comes, now in despight of ills
I'le speak to him, and I will hear him speak,
And do my best to drive it from his heart.
Enter Husband.
Hus.
Pox of the last throw, it made
Five hundred Angels vanish from my sight:
I'me damn'd, Ime damn'd, the Angels have forsook me;
Nay 'tis certainly true: for he that has no coyn,
Is damn'd in this world; he's gone, he's gone.
Wife.
Dear Husband.
Hus.
Oh!
most punishment of all, I have a Wife.
Wife.
I doe entreat you as you love your soule,
Tell me the cause of this your discontent.
Hus.
A vengeance strip thee naked, thou art cause,
Effect, quality, property, thou, thou, thou.Exit.
Wife.
Bad turn'd to worse?
Both beggery of the soule as of the body,
And so much unlike himself at first,
As if some vexed spirit had got his form upon him.
Enter Husband again.
He comes again,
He sayes I am the cause, I never yet
Spoke lesse then words of duty and of love.
Hus.
If marriage be honourable, then Cuckolds are
honourable, for they cannot be made without marriage.
Fool, what meant I to marry to get Beggars?
Now must my eldest Son be a Knave or nothing, he cannot live but upoth' fool, for he will have no Land to
maintain him: that morgage sits like a snaffle upon mine
inheritance, and makes me chaw upon Iron.
My second Son must be a promoter, and my third a
Thief, or an under-putter, a Slave Pander.
Oh beggery, beggery, to what base uses doth it put a man.
I think the Devil scorns to be a Bawd:
He beares himself more proudly, has more care on his
credite.
Base, slavish, abject, filthy poverty.
Wi.
Good sir, by all our vowes I doe beseech you,
Shew me the true cause of your discontent.
Hus.
Mony, mony, mony, and thou must supply me.
Wi.
Alass, I am the least cause of your discontent.
Yet what is mine, either in Rings or Jewels,
Use to your own desire, but I beseech you,
As you are a Gentleman by many bloods,
Though I my self be out of your respect,
Think on the state of these three lovely boyes
You have been Father to.
Hus.
Puh, Bastards, Bastards, Bastards, begot in tricks,
begot in tricks.
Wi.
Heaven knowes how those words wrong me,
But I'le endure these griefs among a thousand more:
Oh call to mind your Lands already morgag'd,
Your self wound into debts, your hopefull Brother
At the University into bonds for you,
Like to be seiz'd upon.
And----Hus.
Ha done, thou Harlot,
Whom though for fashion I married,
I never could abide.
Think'st thou thy words
Shall kill my pleasure?
fall off to thy friends,
Thou and thy Bastards beg, I will not bate
A whit in humour: Midnight still I love you,
And revel in your company: curb'd in?
Shall it be said in all societies,
That I broke custome?
that I flagd in money?
No, those thy Jewels I will play as freely,
As when my state was fullest.
Wife.
Be it so.
Hus.
Nay I protest, and take that for an earnest,
He spurns her.
I will for ever hold thee in contempt,
And never touch the Sheets that cover thee,
But be divorc't in bed, till thou consent,
Thy dowry shall be sold to give new life
Unto those pleasures which I most affect.
Wife.
Sir, do but turn a gentle eye on me,
And what the law shall give me leave to do,
You shall command.
Hus.Look it be done, shall I want dust,
And like a Slave wear nothing in my pockets,
Holds his Hands in his Pockets.
But my hands to fill them up with nayles?
Oh much against my blood, let it be done,
I was never made to be a loker on:
A Bawde to Dice; I'le shake the Drabs my self,
And make them yield, I say look it be done.
Wife.
I take my leave, it shall.Exit.
Hus.
Speedily, speedily, I hate the very hour I chose
a Wife, a trouble, trouble, three Children like three evils
hang upon me, fie, fie, fie, strumpet and bastards, strumpet and bastards.
Enter three Gentlemen, hearing him.
1.
Gent.
Still do these loathsome thoughts jar on your
Tongue?
Your self to stain the honour of your Wife,
Nobly discended; those whom men call mad,
Endangers others, but he's more then mad
That wounds himself, whose own words
Do proclaime it is not fit, I pray forsake it.
2.
Gen. Good sir, let modesty reprove you.
3.
Gen. Let honest kindness sway so much with you.
Hus.
God den, I thank you, sir, how do you?
adieu, I
am glad to see you, farewell Instructions, Admonitions.
Exeunt Gent.
Enter a Servant.
How now sirrha?
what would you?
Ser.
Onely to certifie you, sir, that my Mistresse was
met by the way, by them who were sent for her up to
London by her honourable Unckle, your Worships late
Guardian.
Hus.
So, sir, then she is gone, and so may you be,
But let her look that the thing be done she wots of,
Or hell will stand more pleasant then her house at home.
Exit Servant.
Enter a Gentleman.
Gent.
Well or ill met, I care not.
Hus.
No nor I.
Gent.
I am come with confidence to chide you.
Hus.
Who me?
chide me?
do't finely then, let it not
move me, for if thou chid'st me angry, I shall strike.
Gent.
Strike thine own follies, for it is they
Deserve to be well beaten; we are now in private,
There's none but thou and I, thou art fond and peevish,
An unclean Rioter, thy lands and credit
Lie now both sick of a consumption,
I am sorry for thee; that man spends with shame,
That with his riches doth consume his name,
And such art thou.
Hus.
Peace.
Gent.
No, thou shalt hear me further.
Thy fathers and fore-fathers worthy honours,
Which were our Countrey monuments, our grace,
Follies in thee begin now to deface.
The spring time of thy youth did fairly promise
Such a most fruitfull summer to thy friends,
It scarce can enter into mens beliefs,
Such dearth should hang on thee, we that see it,
Are sorry to believe it: in thy change,
This voice into all places will be hurld:
Thou and the Devil has deceiv'd the world.
Hus.
I'le not endure thee.
Gent.
But of all the worst,
Thy virtuous wife, right honourably allied,
Thou hast proclaim'd a strumpet.
Hus.
Nay then I know thee,
Thou art lier Champion thou, her private friend,
The party you wot on.
Gent.
Oh ignoble thought,
I am past my patient bloud, shall I stand idle
And see my reputation toucht to death?
Hus.
This has gal'd you, has it?
Gent.
No monster, I prove
My thoughts did onely tend to virtuous love.
Hus.
Love of her virtues?
there it goes.
Gent.
Base spirit, to lay thy hate upon
The fruitfull honour of thine own bed.
They fight, and the Husband is hurt.
Hus.
Oh.
Gent.
Wilt thou yield it yet?
Hus.
Sir, sir, I have not done with you.
I hope, nor ne're shall do.Fight agen.
Hus.
Have you got tricks?
are you in cunning with me?
Gent.
No, plain and right.
He needs no cunning that for truth doth fight.
Husband falls down.
Hus.
Hard fortune, am I level'd with the ground?
Gent.
Now, sir, you lie at mercy.
Hus.
I, you slave.
Gent.
Alas, that hate should bring us to our grave,
You see, my Sword's not thirsty for your life,
I am sorrier for your wound, then your self;
Y'are of a virtuous house, shew virtuous deeds,
'Tis not your honour, 'tis your folly bleeds:
Much good has been expected in your life,
Cancel not all mens hopes, you have a Wife,
Kind and obedient: heap not wrongfull shame
On her and your posterity: let only sin be sore,
And by this fall, rise never to fall more.
And so I leave you.Exit.
Hus.
Has the dog left me then,
After his tooth hath left me?
Oh, my heart
Would fain leap after him, revenge I say,
I'me mad to be reveng'd, my strumpet Wife,
It is thy quarrel that rips thus my flesh,
And makes my breast spit bloud, but thou shalt bleed:
Vanquisht?
got down?
unable e'en to speak?
Surely 'tis want of money makes men weak,
I, 'twas that ore-threw me, I'de nere been down else.Exit.
Enter Wife in a riding-sute, with a Serving-man.
Ser.
Faith Mistress, if it may not be presumption
In me to tell you so, for his excuse
You had small reason, knowing his abuse.
Wife.
I grant I had, but alas,
Why should our faults at home be spread abroad?
'Tis grief enough within doors; at first sight
Mine Uncle could run o're his prodigal life
As perfectly, as if his serious eye
Had numbred all his follies:
Knew of his morgag'd lands, his friends in bonds,
Himself withered with debt; and in that minute
Had I added his usage and unkindness,
'Twould have confounded every thought of good:
Where now, fathering his riots on his youth,
Which time and tame experience will shake off,
Guessing his kindness to me (as I smooth'd him
With all the skill I had) though his deserts
Are in form uglier then an unshapt Bear.
He's ready to prefer him to some Office
And place at Court: a good and sure releif
To all his stooping fortunes, 'twill be a means, I hope,
To make new league between us, and redeem
His virtues with his lands.
Ser.
I should think so: Mistress, if he should not now
be kind to you, and love you, and cherish you up, I should
think the Devil himself kept open house in him.
Wife.
I doubt not but he will now, prythee leave me,
I think I hear him coming.
Serv.
I am gone.Exit.
Wife.
By this good means I shall preserve my lands,
And free my husband out of Usurers hands:
Now there is no need of sale, my Uncle's kind,
I hope, if ought, this will content his mind.
Here comes my husband.Enter Husband.
Hus.
Now, are you come?
where's the money?
let's
see the money, is the rubbish sold?
those wiseakers your
Lands, why then, the money, where is it?
poure it
down, down with it, down with it; I say pour't on the
groound, let's see it, let's see it.
Wife.
Good sir, keep but in patience, and I hope
My words shall like you well, I bring you better
Comfort then the sale of my Dowry.
Hus.
Ha, what's that?
Wife.
Pray do not fright me, sir, but vouchsafe me hearing.
My Uncle, glad of your kindness to me and mild useage (for so I made it to him) hath in pitty of your declining fortunes, provided a place for you at Court, of worth
and credit; which so much overjoyed me---Hus.
Out on thee, filth, over and over-joyed,
When I'me in torment.spurns her.
Thou politick whore, subtiller then nine Devils, was
this thy journey to Nunck, to set down the history of
me, my state and fortunes:
Shall I, that dedicated my self to pleasure, be now confin'd in service to crouch, and stand like an old man ith'
hams, my Hat off?
I that could never abide to uncover
my head ith' Church: base slut, this fruit beares thy complaints.
Wife.
Oh, heaven knowes,
That my complaints were praises, and best words
Of you, and your estate; onely my friends
Knew of your morgag'd Lands, and were possest
Of every accident before I came.
If you suspect it but a plot in me,
To keep my dowry, or for mine own good,
Or my poor Childrens (though it suits a mother
To shew a naturall care in their reliefs)
Yet I'le forget my self to calme your blood,
Consume it, as your pleasure counsels you,
And all I wish, e'ne Clemency affords,
Give me but pleasant looks, and modest words.
Hus.
Mony, whore, mony, or I'le.---- draws his dagger.
Enter a Servant hastily.
What the Devil?
how now thy hasty newes?
Ser.
May it please you, sir.
Hus.What, may I not look upon my Dagger?
Speak, Villain, or I will execute the point on thee:
quick, short.
Ser.
Why sir, a Gentleman from the University stayes
below to speak with you.
Hus.
From the University?
so, University,
That long word runs through me.Exit.
Wife.
Was ever Wife so wretchedly beset?
Had not this newes stept in between, the point
Had offered violence unto my breast.
That which some women call great misery,
Would shew but little here, would scarce be seen
Among my miseries: I may compare
For wretched fortunes, with all Wives that are,
Nothing will please him, untill all be nothing.
He calls it slavery to be preferr'd,
A place of credit, a base servitude.
What shall become of me, and my poor Children?
Two here, and one at Nurse, my pretty beggars,
I see how ruine with a palsie hand
Begins to shake the ancient seat to dust:
The heavy weight of sorrow drawes my lids
Over my dankish eyes: I can scarce see;
Thus grief will last, it wakes and sleeps with me.
Enter the Husband with the Master of the Colledge.
Hus.
Please you draw near, sir, y'are exceeding welcome.
Ma.
That's my doubt, I fear I come not to be welcome.
Hus.
Yes, howsoever.
Ma.
'Tis not my fashion, sir, to dwell in long circumstance, but to be plain and effectuall; therefore to
the purpose.
The cause of my setting forth was pittious and lamentable; that hopefull young Gentleman your Brother, whose
virtues we all love dearly, through your default and unnaturall negligence, lies in bond executed for your debt, a
prisoner, all his studies amazed, his hope struck dead, and
the pride of his youth muffled in these dark clouds of oppression.
Hus.
Hum, hum, hum.
Mast.
Oh you have kill'd the towardest hope of all
our University, wherefore without repentance and amends, expect ponderous and sudden judgements to fall
grievously upon you; your Brother, a man who profited
in his divine employments, and might have made ten
thousand soules fit for heaven, now by your carelesse
courses cast in prison, which you must answer for, and
assure your spirit it will come home at length.
Hus.
Oh God, oh.
Ma.
Wise men think ill of you, others speak ill of you, no
man loves you, nay, even those whom honesty condemns,
condemns you: and take this from the virtuous affection
I bear your Brother, never look for prosperous hour,
good thought, quiet sleeps, contented walks, nor any
thing that makes man perfect, till you redeem him: what
is your answer?
how will you bestow him?
upon desperate misery, or better hopes?
I suffer till I hear your answer.
Hus.
Sir, you have much wrought with me, I feel you
in my soule, you are your Arts master.
I never had sence till now; your syllables have cleft me,
both for your words and pains I thank you: I cannot
but acknowledge grievous wrongs done to my Brother,
mighty, mighty, mighty, mighty wrongs.
Within there.
Enter a Servingman.
Hus.
Fill me a Bowle of Wine.
Alass poor Brother,
Bruised with an execution for my sake.
Ma.
A bruise indeed makes many a mortall sore,
Till the Grave cure them.Enter with Wine.
Hus.
Sir, I begin to you, y'ave chid your welcome.
Ma.
I could have wisht it better for your sake,
I pledge you, sir, to the kind man in prison.
Hus.
Let it be so.
Now, sir, if you so please, to spend but a few minutes in
walking about my grounds below, my man shall here
attend you: I doubt not but by that time to be furnisht
of a sufficient answer, and therein my Brother fully satisfied.
Ma.
Good sir, in that the Angels would be pleased,
and the worlds murmures calm'd, and I should say, I set
forth then upon a lucky day.Exit.
Hus.
O thou confused man, thy pleasant sins have undone thee, thy damnation has begger'd thee, that heaven
should say we must not sin, and yet made women: gives
our sences way to find pleasure, which being found, confounds us, why should we know those things so much
misuse us?
Oh would virtue had been forbidden, we
should then have proved all virtuous, for 'tis our blood
to love what we are forbidden, what man would have
been forbidden, what man would have been fool to a
beast, and zany to a swine, to shew tricks in the mire,
what is there in three Dice, to make a man draw thrice
three thousand acres into the compasse of a little round table, and with the Gentlemans palsie in the hand shake
out his posterity, thieves, or beggars; 'tis done, I have
don't ifaith: terrible, horrible misery,----------how well
was I left, very well, very well.
My Lands shewed like a Full-Moon about me, but
now the Moon's in the last quarter, waining, waining,
and I am mad to think that Moon was mine:
mine and my fathers, and my fore-fathers generations,
generations, down goes the house of us, down, down it
sinks: Now is the name a beggar, begs in me that name
which hundreds of years has made this Shire famous; in
me and my posterity runs out.
In my seed five are made miserable besides my self,
my Riot is now my Brothers Jaylor, my Wifes sighing,
my three boyes penury, and mine own confusion.
He tears his hair.
Why sit my hairs upon my cursed head?
Will not this poison scatter them?
oh my Brother's
In execution among devils that stretch him:
And make him give; and I in want,
Not able for to live, nor to redeem him.
Divines and dying men may talk of hell,
But in my heart her several torments dwell,
Slavery and misery.
Who in this case
Would not take up money upon his soul?
Pawn his salvation, live at interest:
I, that did ever in abundance dwell,
For me to want, exceeds the throws of hell.
Enter his little son, with a Top and Scourge.
Son.
What aile you father, are you not well, I cannot
scourge my Top as long as you stand so: you take up all
the room with your wide legs, puh, you cannot make me
afraid with this, I fear no vizards, nor bugbears.
He takes up the child by the skirts of his long coat in one
hand, and draws his dagger with the other.
Hus.
Up sir, for here thou hast no inheritance left.
Son.
Oh what will you do father, I am your white
boy.Strikes him.
Hus.
Thou shalt be my red boy, take that.
Son.
Oh you hurt me father.
Hus.
My eldest beggar, thou shalt not live to ask an
usurer bred, to cry at a great mans gate, or follow, good
your Honour by a Coach, no, nor your brother: 'tis charity to brain you.
Son.
How shall I learn now my head's broke?
Hus.
Bleed, bleed, rather then beg, beg,stabs him.
Be not thy names disgrace:
Spurn thou thy fortunes first, if they be base:
Come view thy second Brother: Fates,
My childrens bloud shall spin into your faces,
You shall see,
How confidently we scorn beggery.
Exit with his son.
Enter a maid with a child in her armes, the
Mother by her asleep.
Maid.
Sleep sweet babe, sorrow makes thy mother sleep,
It boads small good when heavinesse falls so deep,
Hush, pretty boy, thy hopes might have bin better,
'Tis lost at Dice, what ancient honour won,
Hard when the father plaies away the Son:
Nothing but misery serves in this house,
Ruine and desolation; oh.
Enter Husband with the Boy bleeding.
Hus.
Whore, give me that Boy.
He strives with her for the child.
Maid.
Oh help, help, out alas, murder, murder.
Hus.
Are you gossiping, prating sturdy quean,
I'le break your clamour with your neck,
Down stayers; tumble, tumble, headlong,
He throws her down.
So, the surest way to charme a womans tongue,
Is break her neck, a Polititain did it.
Son.Mother, mother, I am kill'd mother.
His wife awakes, and catcheth up the youngest.
Wife.
Ha, who's that cry'd?
O me my children,
Both, both; bloudy, bloudy.
Hus.
Strumpet, let go the boy, let go the beggar.
Wife.
Oh my sweet husband.
Hus.
Filth, Harlot.
Wife.
Oh, what will you do, dear husband?
Hus.
Give me the bastard.
Wife.
Your own sweet boy.
Hus.
There are too many beggars.
Wife.
Good my husband.
Hus.
Do'st thou prevent me still?
Wife.
Oh God!
Stabs at the child in her armes, and gets it from her.
Hus.Have at his heart.
Wife.
Oh my dear boy.
Hus.
B
rat, thou shalt not live to shame thy house.
Wife.
Oh heaven.She is hurt and sinks down.
Hus.
And perish, now be gone,
There's whores enow, and want would make thee one.
Enter a lusty Servant.
Ser.
Oh sir, what deeds are these?
Hus.
Base slave, my vassail,
Com'st thou between my fury to question me?
Ser.
Were you the devil, I would hold you, sir.
Hus.
Hold me?
presumption, I'le undo thee for it.
Ser.
'Sbloud, you have undone us all, sir.
Hus.Tug at thy Master?
Ser.
Tug at a monster.
Hus.
Have I no power?
shall my slave fetter me?
Ser.
Nay then the devil wrastles, I am thrown.
Husband overcomes him.
Hus.
Oh villain, now I'le tug thee, now I'le tear thee,
set quick spurs to my vassail, bruise him, trample him;
so, I think thou wilt not follow me in haste.
My horse stands ready sadled, away, away,
Now to my brat at nurse, my sucking beggar;
Fates, I'le not leave you one to trample on.
The Master meets him.
Mr. How is't with you sir, me-thinks you look of a
distracted colour.
Hus.
Who, I sir?
'tis but your fancy,
Please you walk in, sir, and I'le soon resolve you,
I want one small part to make up the sum,
And then my brother shall rest satisfied.
M. I shall be glad to see it, sir, I'le attend you.Exeunt.
Ser.
Oh, I am scarce able to heave up my self,
He has so bruis'd me with his devillish weight,
And torn my flesh with his bloud-hasty spur,
A man before of easie constitution,
Till now hells power supplied, to his souls wrong,
Oh how damnation can make weak men strong.
Enter Master and two servants.
Ser.
Oh the most pittious deed, sir, since you came.
Mr. A deadly greeting; hath he sum'd up these
To satisfie his brother?
here's another,
And by the bleeding infants, the dead mother.
Wife.
Oh, oh.
Ma.
Surgeons, Surgeons, she recovers life,
One of his men all faint and bloudied.
1.
Ser.
Follow, our murderous Master has took
Horse to kill his child at nurse, oh follow quickly.
Ma.
I am the readiest, it shall be my charge
To raise the Town upon him.
Exit Master and Servants.
1.
Ser.
Good sir follow him.
Wife.
Oh my children.
1.
Ser.
How is it my most afflicted Mistress?
Wife.
Why do I now recover?
why half live?
To see my children bleed before mine eyes,
A sight, able to kill a Mothers breast without an Executioner; what, art thou mangled too?
1.
Ser.
I thinking to prevent what his quick mischiefs
had so soon acted, came and rusht upon him,
We strugled, but a fouler strength then his
Ore-threw me with his armes, then he did bruise me,
And rent my flesh, and rob'd me of my hair,
Like a man mad in execution,
Made me unfit to rise and follow him.
Wife.
What is it hath beguil'd him of all grace?
And stole away humanity from his breast,
To slay his children, purposed to kill his wife,
And spoil his servants.
Enter two Servants.
Both.
Please you leave this accursed place,
A Surgeon waits within.
Wife.
Willing to leave it;
'Tis guilty of sweet bloud, innocent bloud,
Murder hath took this chamber with full hands,
And will not out as long as the house stands.Exeunt.
Enter Husband, as being thrown off his
horse, and falls.
Hus.
Oh stumbling Jade, the spavin overtake thee,
The fifty diseases stop thee:
Oh, I am sorely bruis'd, plague founder thee,
Thou run'st at ease and pleasure, heart of chance,
To throw me now, within a flight o'th'Town,
In such plain even ground,
Sfoot, a man may dice upon it, and throw away the
Meadows, ah filthy beast.
Cry within.
Follow, follow, follow.
Hus.
Ha?
I hear sounds of men, like hue and cry;
Up, up, and struggle to my horse, make on,
Dispatch that little Beggar, and all's done.
Cry within.
Here, this way, this way.
Hus.
At my back?
oh,
What fate have I, my limbs deny me to go,
My will is bated, Beggery claims a part,
Oh I could here reach to the infants heart.
Enter Master of the Colledge, three Gentlemen, and
others with Halberds.
All.
Here, here, yonder, yonder.
Ma.
Unnatural, flinty, more then barbarous,
The Scythians in their marble-hearted fates,
Could not have acted more remorseless deeds
In their relentless natures, then these of thine:
Was this the answer I long waited on,
The satisfaction for thy prisoned brother?
Hus.
He can have no more of us, then our skins,
And some of them want but fleaing.
1.
Gent.
Great sinnes have made him impudent.
Ma.
Has shed so much bloud, that he cannot blush.
2.
Gent.
Away with him, bear him to the Justices,
A Gentleman of worship dwells at hand,
There shall his deeds be blazed.
Hus.
Why all the better,
My glory 'tis to have my action known,
I grieve for nothing, but I mist of one.
Ma.
There's little of a father in that grief:
Bear him away.Exeunt.
Enter a Knight, with two or three Gentlemen.
Knight.
Endangered so his Wife, murdered his
Children?
1.
Gent.
So the cry goes.
Knight.I am sorry I e're knew him.
That ever he took life and natural being
From such an honoured stock, and fair descent,
Till this black minute without stain or blemish.
1.
Gent.
Here come the men.
Enter the Master of the Colledge, and the rest
with the Prisoner.
Knight.
The Serpent of his house: I'me sorry for this
time, that I am in place of justice.
Ma.
Please you, sir.
Knight.
Do not repeat it twice, I know too much,
Would it had nere been thought on.
Sir, I bleed for you.
1.
Gent.
Your father's sorrows are alive in me:
What made you shew such monstrous cruelty?
Hus.
In a word, sir,
I have consum'd all, plaid away long acre,
And I thought it the charitablest deed I could do,
To cozen Beggery, and knock my house o'th'head.
Kni.
I do not think, but in to morrow's judgement,
The terrour will sit closer to your soul,
When the dread thought of Death remembers you;
To further which, take this sad voice from me,
Never was act plaid more unnaturally.
Hus.
I thank you, Sir.
Knight.
Go lead him to the Jayle.
Where justice claims all, there must pitty fail.
Hus.
Come, come, away with me.
Exit Prisoner.
Ma.
Sir, you deserve the worship of you place,
Would all did so, in you the Law is grace.
Knight.It is my wish it should be so;
Ruinous man, the desolation of his house,
The blot upon his predecessor's honour'd name:
That man is nearest shame, that is past shame.Exit.
Enter Husband with the Officers, the Master and Gentlemen, as going by his house.
Hus.
I am right against my house, seat of my Ancestors: I hear my Wife's alive, but much endangered;
let me intreat to speak with her before the prison
gripe me.
Enter his Wife brought in a Chair,
Gent.
See here she comes of her self.
Wife.
Oh my sweet husband, my deer distressed husband, now in the hands of unrelenting laws, my greatest
sorrow, my extreamest bleeding; now my soul bleeds.
Hus.
How now?
kind to me?
did not I wound
thee, leave thee for dead?
Wife.
Tut, far greater wounds did my breast feel,
Unkindnesse strikes a deeper wound then steel,
You have been still unkind to me.
Hus.
Faith, and so I think I have;
I did my murders roughly out of hand,
Desperate and sudden, but thou hast devis'd
A fine way now to kill me, thou hast given mine eyes
Seaven wounds apiece; now glides the devil from
Me, departs at every joint, heaves up my nails.
Oh catch him new torments, that were nere invented:
Bind him one thousand more you blessed Angels,
In that bottomlesse pit, let him not rise
To make men act unnatural Tragedies,
To spread into a Father, and in fury,
Make him his childrens executioners,
Murder his wife, his servants, and who not?
For that man's dark, where heaven is quite forgot.
Wife.
Oh my repentant husband.
Hus.
My dear soul, whom I too much have wrong'd
For death I die, and for this have I long'd.
Wife.
Thou should'st not (be assured) for these faults
Die, if the law could forgive as soon as I.
Children laid out.
Hus.
What sight is yonder?
Wife.
Oh our two bleeding boyes
Laid forth upon the threshold.
Hus.
Here's weight enough to make a heart-string crack,
Oh were it lawfull that your pretty souls
Might look from heaven into your fathers eyes,
Then should you see the penitent glasses melt,
And both your murders shoot upon my cheeks,
But you are playing in the Angels laps,
And will not look on me,
Who void of grace, kill'd you in beggery.
Oh that I might my wishes now attain,
I should then wish you living were again;
Though I did beg with you, which thing I fear'd,
Oh 'twas the enemy my eyes so blear'd.
Oh would you could pray heaven me to forgive,
That will unto my end repentant live.
Wife.
It makes me e'en forget all other sorrows,
And leave part with this.
Officer.
Come, will you go?
Hus.
I'le kisse the bloud I spilt, and then I'le go,
My soul is bloudied, well may my lips be so.
Farewell dear Wife, now thou and I must part,
I of thy wrongs, repent me with my heart.
Wife.
Oh stay.
thou shalt not go.
Hus.
That's but in vain, you see it must be so.
Farewell ye bloudy ashes of my boyes,
My punishments are their eternal joyes.
Let every father look well into his deeds,
And then their heirs may prosper, while mine bleeds.
Exeunt Husband with Officers.
Wife.
More wretched am I now in this distresse.
Then former sorrows made me.
Mr. Oh kind Wife, be comforted,
One joy is yet unmurdered,
you have a boy at nurse, your joy's in him.
Wife.
Dearer then all is my poor husband's life:
Heaven give my body strength, which is yet faint
With much expence of bloud, and I will kneel,
Sue for his life, number up all my friends,
To plead for pardon for my dear husbandls life.
Mr. Was it in man to wound so kind a creature?
I'le ever praise a woman for thy sake.
I must return with grief, my answer's set,
I shall bring news weighes heavier then the debt.
Two Brothers; the one in bond lies overthrown,
This, on a deadlier execution.
FINIS.
ACT 1
=====

Scene 1
=======
[Thunder and Lightning.
Enter three Witches.]
FIRST WITCH
When shall we three meet again?
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?
SECOND WITCH
When the hurly-burly's done,
When the battle's lost and won.
THIRD WITCH
That will be ere the set of sun.
FIRST WITCH
Where the place?
SECOND WITCH  Upon the heath.
THIRD WITCH
There to meet with Macbeth.
FIRST WITCH  I come, Graymalkin.
SECOND WITCH  Paddock calls.
THIRD WITCH  Anon.
ALL
Fair is foul, and foul is fair;
Hover through the fog and filthy air.
[They exit.]
Scene 2
=======
[Alarum within.
Enter King Duncan, Malcolm,
Donalbain, Lennox, with Attendants, meeting a bleeding
Captain.]
DUNCAN
What bloody man is that?
He can report,
As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
The newest state.
MALCOLM  This is the sergeant
Who, like a good and hardy soldier, fought
'Gainst my captivity.--Hail, brave friend!
Say to the King the knowledge of the broil
As thou didst leave it.
CAPTAIN  Doubtful it stood,
As two spent swimmers that do cling together
And choke their art.
The merciless Macdonwald
(Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
The multiplying villainies of nature
Do swarm upon him) from the Western Isles
Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
And Fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Showed like a rebel's whore.
But all's too weak;
For brave Macbeth (well he deserves that name),
Disdaining Fortune, with his brandished steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like Valor's minion, carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;
Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
Till he unseamed him from the nave to th' chops,
And fixed his head upon our battlements.
DUNCAN
O valiant cousin, worthy gentleman!
CAPTAIN
As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
Shipwracking storms and direful thunders break,
So from that spring whence comfort seemed to
come
Discomfort swells.
Mark, King of Scotland, mark:
No sooner justice had, with valor armed,
Compelled these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,
With furbished arms and new supplies of men,
Began a fresh assault.
DUNCAN
Dismayed not this our captains, Macbeth and
Banquo?
CAPTAIN
Yes, as sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
If I say sooth, I must report they were
As cannons overcharged with double cracks,
So they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe.
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds
Or memorize another Golgotha,
I cannot tell--
But I am faint.
My gashes cry for help.
DUNCAN
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds:
They smack of honor both.--Go, get him surgeons.
[The Captain is led off by Attendants.]
[Enter Ross and Angus.]
Who comes here?
MALCOLM  The worthy Thane of Ross.
LENNOX
What a haste looks through his eyes!
So should he look that seems to speak things
strange.
ROSS  God save the King.
DUNCAN  Whence cam'st thou, worthy thane?
ROSS  From Fife, great king,
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
And fan our people cold.
Norway himself, with terrible numbers,
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor,
The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict,
Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapped in proof,
Confronted him with self-comparisons,
Point against point, rebellious arm 'gainst arm,
Curbing his lavish spirit.
And to conclude,
The victory fell on us.
DUNCAN  Great happiness!
ROSS  That now Sweno,
The Norways' king, craves composition.
Nor would we deign him burial of his men
Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's Inch
Ten thousand dollars to our general use.
DUNCAN
No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive
Our bosom interest.
Go, pronounce his present
death,
And with his former title greet Macbeth.
ROSS  I'll see it done.
DUNCAN
What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.
[They exit.]
Scene 3
=======
[Thunder.
Enter the three Witches.]
FIRST WITCH  Where hast thou been, sister?
SECOND WITCH  Killing swine.
THIRD WITCH  Sister, where thou?
FIRST WITCH
A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap
And munched and munched and munched.
"Give
me," quoth I.
"Aroint thee, witch," the rump-fed runnion cries.
Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' th' Tiger;
But in a sieve I'll thither sail,
And, like a rat without a tail,
I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.
SECOND WITCH
I'll give thee a wind.
FIRST WITCH
Th' art kind.
THIRD WITCH
And I another.
FIRST WITCH
I myself have all the other,
And the very ports they blow;
All the quarters that they know
I' th' shipman's card.
I'll drain him dry as hay.
Sleep shall neither night nor day
Hang upon his penthouse lid.
He shall live a man forbid.
Weary sev'nnights, nine times nine,
Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine.
Though his bark cannot be lost,
Yet it shall be tempest-tossed.
Look what I have.
SECOND WITCH  Show me, show me.
FIRST WITCH
Here I have a pilot's thumb,
Wracked as homeward he did come.
[Drum within.]
THIRD WITCH
A drum, a drum!
Macbeth doth come.
ALL, [dancing in a circle]
The Weird Sisters, hand in hand,
Posters of the sea and land,
Thus do go about, about,
Thrice to thine and thrice to mine
And thrice again, to make up nine.
Peace, the charm's wound up.
[Enter Macbeth and Banquo.]
MACBETH
So foul and fair a day I have not seen.
BANQUO
How far is 't called to Forres?--What are these,
So withered, and so wild in their attire,
That look not like th' inhabitants o' th' Earth
And yet are on 't?--Live you?
Or are you aught
That man may question?
You seem to understand
me
By each at once her choppy finger laying
Upon her skinny lips.
You should be women,
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
That you are so.
MACBETH  Speak if you can.
What are you?
FIRST WITCH
All hail, Macbeth!
Hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!
SECOND WITCH
All hail, Macbeth!
Hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!
THIRD WITCH
All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be king hereafter!
BANQUO
Good sir, why do you start and seem to fear
Things that do sound so fair?--I' th' name of truth,
Are you fantastical, or that indeed
Which outwardly you show?
My noble partner
You greet with present grace and great prediction
Of noble having and of royal hope,
That he seems rapt withal.
To me you speak not.
If you can look into the seeds of time
And say which grain will grow and which will not,
Speak, then, to me, who neither beg nor fear
Your favors nor your hate.
FIRST WITCH  Hail!
SECOND WITCH  Hail!
THIRD WITCH  Hail!
FIRST WITCH
Lesser than Macbeth and greater.
SECOND WITCH
Not so happy, yet much happier.
THIRD WITCH
Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none.
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
FIRST WITCH
Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
MACBETH
Stay, you imperfect speakers.
Tell me more.
By Sinel's death I know I am Thane of Glamis.
But how of Cawdor?
The Thane of Cawdor lives
A prosperous gentleman, and to be king
Stands not within the prospect of belief,
No more than to be Cawdor.
Say from whence
You owe this strange intelligence or why
Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
With such prophetic greeting.
Speak, I charge you.
[Witches vanish.]
BANQUO
The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,
And these are of them.
Whither are they vanished?
MACBETH
Into the air, and what seemed corporal melted,
As breath into the wind.
Would they had stayed!
BANQUO
Were such things here as we do speak about?
Or have we eaten on the insane root
That takes the reason prisoner?
MACBETH
Your children shall be kings.
BANQUO  You shall be king.
MACBETH
And Thane of Cawdor too.
Went it not so?
BANQUO
To th' selfsame tune and words.--Who's here?
[Enter Ross and Angus.]
ROSS
The King hath happily received, Macbeth,
The news of thy success, and, when he reads
Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,
His wonders and his praises do contend
Which should be thine or his.
Silenced with that,
In viewing o'er the rest o' th' selfsame day
He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
Strange images of death.
As thick as tale
Came post with post, and every one did bear
Thy praises in his kingdom's great defense,
And poured them down before him.
ANGUS  We are sent
To give thee from our royal master thanks,
Only to herald thee into his sight,
Not pay thee.
ROSS
And for an earnest of a greater honor,
He bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor,
In which addition, hail, most worthy thane,
For it is thine.
BANQUO  What, can the devil speak true?
MACBETH
The Thane of Cawdor lives.
Why do you dress me
In borrowed robes?
ANGUS  Who was the Thane lives yet,
But under heavy judgment bears that life
Which he deserves to lose.
Whether he was
combined
With those of Norway, or did line the rebel
With hidden help and vantage, or that with both
He labored in his country's wrack, I know not;
But treasons capital, confessed and proved,
Have overthrown him.
MACBETH, [aside]  Glamis and Thane of Cawdor!
The greatest is behind.
[To Ross and Angus.]
Thanks
for your pains.
[Aside to Banquo.]
Do you not hope your children
shall be kings,
When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me
Promised no less to them?
BANQUO  That, trusted home,
Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
Besides the Thane of Cawdor.
But 'tis strange.
And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
Win us with honest trifles, to betray 's
In deepest consequence.--
Cousins, a word, I pray you.
[They step aside.]
MACBETH, [aside]  Two truths are told
As happy prologues to the swelling act
Of the imperial theme.--I thank you, gentlemen.
[Aside.]
This supernatural soliciting
Cannot be ill, cannot be good.
If ill,
Why hath it given me earnest of success
Commencing in a truth?
I am Thane of Cawdor.
If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs
Against the use of nature?
Present fears
Are less than horrible imaginings.
My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,
Shakes so my single state of man
That function is smothered in surmise,
And nothing is but what is not.
BANQUO  Look how our partner's rapt.
MACBETH, [aside]
If chance will have me king, why, chance may
crown me
Without my stir.
BANQUO  New honors come upon him,
Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mold
But with the aid of use.
MACBETH, [aside]  Come what come may,
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.
BANQUO
Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.
MACBETH
Give me your favor.
My dull brain was wrought
With things forgotten.
Kind gentlemen, your pains
Are registered where every day I turn
The leaf to read them.
Let us toward the King.
[Aside to Banquo.]
Think upon what hath chanced,
and at more time,
The interim having weighed it, let us speak
Our free hearts each to other.
BANQUO  Very gladly.
MACBETH  Till then, enough.--Come, friends.
[They exit.]
Scene 4
=======
[Flourish.
Enter King Duncan, Lennox, Malcolm,
Donalbain, and Attendants.]
DUNCAN
Is execution done on Cawdor?
Are not
Those in commission yet returned?
MALCOLM  My liege,
They are not yet come back.
But I have spoke
With one that saw him die, who did report
That very frankly he confessed his treasons,
Implored your Highness' pardon, and set forth
A deep repentance.
Nothing in his life
Became him like the leaving it.
He died
As one that had been studied in his death
To throw away the dearest thing he owed
As 'twere a careless trifle.
DUNCAN  There's no art
To find the mind's construction in the face.
He was a gentleman on whom I built
An absolute trust.
[Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Ross, and Angus.]
O worthiest cousin,
The sin of my ingratitude even now
Was heavy on me.
Thou art so far before
That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
To overtake thee.
Would thou hadst less deserved,
That the proportion both of thanks and payment
Might have been mine!
Only I have left to say,
More is thy due than more than all can pay.
MACBETH
The service and the loyalty I owe
In doing it pays itself.
Your Highness' part
Is to receive our duties, and our duties
Are to your throne and state children and servants,
Which do but what they should by doing everything
Safe toward your love and honor.
DUNCAN  Welcome hither.
I have begun to plant thee and will labor
To make thee full of growing.--Noble Banquo,
That hast no less deserved nor must be known
No less to have done so, let me enfold thee
And hold thee to my heart.
BANQUO  There, if I grow,
The harvest is your own.
DUNCAN  My plenteous joys,
Wanton in fullness, seek to hide themselves
In drops of sorrow.--Sons, kinsmen, thanes,
And you whose places are the nearest, know
We will establish our estate upon
Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter
The Prince of Cumberland; which honor must
Not unaccompanied invest him only,
But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine
On all deservers.--From hence to Inverness
And bind us further to you.
MACBETH
The rest is labor which is not used for you.
I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful
The hearing of my wife with your approach.
So humbly take my leave.
DUNCAN  My worthy Cawdor.
MACBETH, [aside]
The Prince of Cumberland!
That is a step
On which I must fall down or else o'erleap,
For in my way it lies.
Stars, hide your fires;
Let not light see my black and deep desires.
The eye wink at the hand, yet let that be
Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.
[He exits.]
DUNCAN
True, worthy Banquo.
He is full so valiant,
And in his commendations I am fed:
It is a banquet to me.--Let's after him,
Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome.
It is a peerless kinsman.
[Flourish.
They exit.]
Scene 5
=======
[Enter Macbeth's Wife, alone, with a letter.]
LADY MACBETH, [reading the letter]  They met me in the
day of success, and I have learned by the perfect'st
report they have more in them than mortal knowledge.
When I burned in desire to question them further, they
made themselves air, into which they vanished.
Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives
from the King, who all-hailed me "Thane of Cawdor,"
by which title, before, these Weird Sisters saluted me
and referred me to the coming on of time with "Hail,
king that shalt be."
This have I thought good to deliver
thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou
might'st not lose the dues of rejoicing by being ignorant
of what greatness is promised thee.
Lay it to thy
heart, and farewell.
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be
What thou art promised.
Yet do I fear thy nature;
It is too full o' th' milk of human kindness
To catch the nearest way.
Thou wouldst be great,
Art not without ambition, but without
The illness should attend it.
What thou wouldst
highly,
That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false
And yet wouldst wrongly win.
Thou 'dst have, great
Glamis,
That which cries "Thus thou must do," if thou have
it,
And that which rather thou dost fear to do,
Than wishest should be undone.
Hie thee hither,
That I may pour my spirits in thine ear
And chastise with the valor of my tongue
All that impedes thee from the golden round,
Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
To have thee crowned withal.
[Enter Messenger.]
What is your tidings?
MESSENGER
The King comes here tonight.
LADY MACBETH  Thou 'rt mad to say it.
Is not thy master with him, who, were 't so,
Would have informed for preparation?
MESSENGER
So please you, it is true.
Our thane is coming.
One of my fellows had the speed of him,
Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
Than would make up his message.
LADY MACBETH  Give him tending.
He brings great news.
[Messenger exits.]
The raven himself is hoarse
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
Under my battlements.
Come, you spirits
That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,
And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
Of direst cruelty.
Make thick my blood.
Stop up th' access and passage to remorse,
That no compunctious visitings of nature
Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between
Th' effect and it.
Come to my woman's breasts
And take my milk for gall, you murd'ring ministers,
Wherever in your sightless substances
You wait on nature's mischief.
Come, thick night,
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark
To cry "Hold, hold!"
[Enter Macbeth.]
Great Glamis, worthy Cawdor,
Greater than both by the all-hail hereafter!
Thy letters have transported me beyond
This ignorant present, and I feel now
The future in the instant.
MACBETH  My dearest love,
Duncan comes here tonight.
LADY MACBETH  And when goes hence?
MACBETH
Tomorrow, as he purposes.
LADY MACBETH  O, never
Shall sun that morrow see!
Your face, my thane, is as a book where men
May read strange matters.
To beguile the time,
Look like the time.
Bear welcome in your eye,
Your hand, your tongue.
Look like th' innocent
flower,
But be the serpent under 't.
He that's coming
Must be provided for; and you shall put
This night's great business into my dispatch,
Which shall to all our nights and days to come
Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.
MACBETH
We will speak further.
LADY MACBETH  Only look up clear.
To alter favor ever is to fear.
Leave all the rest to me.
[They exit.]
Scene 6
=======
[Hautboys and Torches.
Enter King Duncan, Malcolm,
Donalbain, Banquo, Lennox, Macduff, Ross, Angus, and
Attendants.]
DUNCAN
This castle hath a pleasant seat.
The air
Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
Unto our gentle senses.
BANQUO  This guest of summer,
The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath
Smells wooingly here.
No jutty, frieze,
Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle.
Where they most breed and haunt, I have
observed,
The air is delicate.
[Enter Lady Macbeth.]
DUNCAN  See, see our honored hostess!--
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,
Which still we thank as love.
Herein I teach you
How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains
And thank us for your trouble.
LADY MACBETH  All our service,
In every point twice done and then done double,
Were poor and single business to contend
Against those honors deep and broad wherewith
Your Majesty loads our house.
For those of old,
And the late dignities heaped up to them,
We rest your hermits.
DUNCAN  Where's the Thane of Cawdor?
We coursed him at the heels and had a purpose
To be his purveyor; but he rides well,
And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath helped
him
To his home before us.
Fair and noble hostess,
We are your guest tonight.
LADY MACBETH  Your servants ever
Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs in compt
To make their audit at your Highness' pleasure,
Still to return your own.
DUNCAN  Give me your hand.
[Taking her hand.]
Conduct me to mine host.
We love him highly
And shall continue our graces towards him.
By your leave, hostess.
[They exit.]
Scene 7
=======
[Hautboys.
Torches.
Enter a Sewer and divers Servants
with dishes and service over the stage.
Then enter
Macbeth.]
MACBETH
If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well
It were done quickly.
If th' assassination
Could trammel up the consequence and catch
With his surcease success, that but this blow
Might be the be-all and the end-all here,
But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
We'd jump the life to come.
But in these cases
We still have judgment here, that we but teach
Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return
To plague th' inventor.
This even-handed justice
Commends th' ingredience of our poisoned chalice
To our own lips.
He's here in double trust:
First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
Who should against his murderer shut the door,
Not bear the knife myself.
Besides, this Duncan
Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
So clear in his great office, that his virtues
Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against
The deep damnation of his taking-off;
And pity, like a naked newborn babe
Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubin horsed
Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
That tears shall drown the wind.
I have no spur
To prick the sides of my intent, but only
Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself
And falls on th' other--

[Enter Lady Macbeth.]
How now, what news?
LADY MACBETH
He has almost supped.
Why have you left the
chamber?
MACBETH
Hath he asked for me?
LADY MACBETH  Know you not he has?
MACBETH
We will proceed no further in this business.
He hath honored me of late, and I have bought
Golden opinions from all sorts of people,
Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,
Not cast aside so soon.
LADY MACBETH  Was the hope drunk
Wherein you dressed yourself?
Hath it slept since?
And wakes it now, to look so green and pale
At what it did so freely?
From this time
Such I account thy love.
Art thou afeard
To be the same in thine own act and valor
As thou art in desire?
Wouldst thou have that
Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life
And live a coward in thine own esteem,
Letting "I dare not" wait upon "I would,"
Like the poor cat i' th' adage?
MACBETH  Prithee, peace.
I dare do all that may become a man.
Who dares do more is none.
LADY MACBETH  What beast was 't,
then,
That made you break this enterprise to me?
When you durst do it, then you were a man;
And to be more than what you were, you would
Be so much more the man.
Nor time nor place
Did then adhere, and yet you would make both.
They have made themselves, and that their fitness
now
Does unmake you.
I have given suck, and know
How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me.
I would, while it was smiling in my face,
Have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums
And dashed the brains out, had I so sworn as you
Have done to this.
MACBETH  If we should fail--

LADY MACBETH  We fail?
But screw your courage to the sticking place
And we'll not fail.
When Duncan is asleep
(Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey
Soundly invite him), his two chamberlains
Will I with wine and wassail so convince
That memory, the warder of the brain,
Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason
A limbeck only.
When in swinish sleep
Their drenched natures lies as in a death,
What cannot you and I perform upon
Th' unguarded Duncan?
What not put upon
His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt
Of our great quell?
MACBETH  Bring forth men-children only,
For thy undaunted mettle should compose
Nothing but males.
Will it not be received,
When we have marked with blood those sleepy two
Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,
That they have done 't?
LADY MACBETH  Who dares receive it other,
As we shall make our griefs and clamor roar
Upon his death?
MACBETH  I am settled and bend up
Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
Away, and mock the time with fairest show.
False face must hide what the false heart doth
know.
[They exit.]
ACT 2
=====

Scene 1
=======
[Enter Banquo, and Fleance with a torch before him.]
BANQUO  How goes the night, boy?
FLEANCE
The moon is down.
I have not heard the clock.
BANQUO  And she goes down at twelve.
FLEANCE  I take 't 'tis later, sir.
BANQUO
Hold, take my sword.
[He gives his sword to Fleance.]
There's husbandry in heaven;
Their candles are all out.
Take thee that too.
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
And yet I would not sleep.
Merciful powers,
Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
Gives way to in repose.
[Enter Macbeth, and a Servant with a torch.]
Give me my sword.--Who's
there?
MACBETH  A friend.
BANQUO
What, sir, not yet at rest?
The King's abed.
He hath been in unusual pleasure, and
Sent forth great largess to your offices.
This diamond he greets your wife withal,
By the name of most kind hostess, and shut up
In measureless content.
[He gives Macbeth a jewel.]
MACBETH  Being unprepared,
Our will became the servant to defect,
Which else should free have wrought.
BANQUO  All's well.
I dreamt last night of the three Weird Sisters.
To you they have showed some truth.
MACBETH  I think not of
them.
Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,
We would spend it in some words upon that
business,
If you would grant the time.
BANQUO  At your kind'st leisure.
MACBETH
If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,
It shall make honor for you.
BANQUO  So I lose none
In seeking to augment it, but still keep
My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,
I shall be counseled.
MACBETH  Good repose the while.
BANQUO  Thanks, sir.
The like to you.
[Banquo and Fleance exit.]
MACBETH
Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,
She strike upon the bell.
Get thee to bed.
[Servant exits.]
Is this a dagger which I see before me,
The handle toward my hand?
Come, let me clutch
thee.
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
To feeling as to sight?
Or art thou but
A dagger of the mind, a false creation
Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
I see thee yet, in form as palpable
As this which now I draw.
[He draws his dagger.]
Thou marshal'st me the way that I was going,
And such an instrument I was to use.
Mine eyes are made the fools o' th' other senses
Or else worth all the rest.
I see thee still,
And, on thy blade and dudgeon, gouts of blood,
Which was not so before.
There's no such thing.
It is the bloody business which informs
Thus to mine eyes.
Now o'er the one-half world
Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
The curtained sleep.
Witchcraft celebrates
Pale Hecate's off'rings, and withered murder,
Alarumed by his sentinel, the wolf,
Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,
With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his
design
Moves like a ghost.
Thou sure and firm-set earth,
Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
Thy very stones prate of my whereabouts
And take the present horror from the time,
Which now suits with it.
Whiles I threat, he lives.
Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
[A bell rings.]
I go, and it is done.
The bell invites me.
Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell
That summons thee to heaven or to hell.
[He exits.]
Scene 2
=======
[Enter Lady Macbeth.]
LADY MACBETH
That which hath made them drunk hath made me
bold.
What hath quenched them hath given me fire.
Hark!--Peace.
It was the owl that shrieked, the fatal bellman,
Which gives the stern'st good-night.
He is about it.
The doors are open, and the surfeited grooms
Do mock their charge with snores.
I have drugged
their possets,
That death and nature do contend about them
Whether they live or die.
MACBETH, [within]  Who's there?
what, ho!
LADY MACBETH
Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,
And 'tis not done.
Th' attempt and not the deed
Confounds us.
Hark!--I laid their daggers ready;
He could not miss 'em.
Had he not resembled
My father as he slept, I had done 't.
[Enter Macbeth with bloody daggers.]
My husband?
MACBETH
I have done the deed.
Didst thou not hear a noise?
LADY MACBETH
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
Did not you speak?
MACBETH  When?
LADY MACBETH  Now.
MACBETH  As I descended?
LADY MACBETH  Ay.
MACBETH  Hark!--Who lies i' th' second chamber?
LADY MACBETH  Donalbain.
MACBETH  This is a sorry sight.
LADY MACBETH
A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.
MACBETH
There's one did laugh in 's sleep, and one cried
"Murder!"
That they did wake each other.
I stood and heard
them.
But they did say their prayers and addressed them
Again to sleep.
LADY MACBETH  There are two lodged together.
MACBETH
One cried "God bless us" and "Amen" the other,
As they had seen me with these hangman's hands,
List'ning their fear.
I could not say "Amen"
When they did say "God bless us."
LADY MACBETH  Consider it not so deeply.
MACBETH
But wherefore could not I pronounce "Amen"?
I had most need of blessing, and "Amen"
Stuck in my throat.
LADY MACBETH  These deeds must not be thought
After these ways; so, it will make us mad.
MACBETH
Methought I heard a voice cry "Sleep no more!
Macbeth does murder sleep"--the innocent sleep,
Sleep that knits up the raveled sleave of care,
The death of each day's life, sore labor's bath,
Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,
Chief nourisher in life's feast.
LADY MACBETH  What do you mean?
MACBETH
Still it cried "Sleep no more!"
to all the house.
"Glamis hath murdered sleep, and therefore
Cawdor
Shall sleep no more.
Macbeth shall sleep no more."
LADY MACBETH
Who was it that thus cried?
Why, worthy thane,
You do unbend your noble strength to think
So brainsickly of things.
Go get some water
And wash this filthy witness from your hand.--
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
They must lie there.
Go, carry them and smear
The sleepy grooms with blood.
MACBETH  I'll go no more.
I am afraid to think what I have done.
Look on 't again I dare not.
LADY MACBETH  Infirm of purpose!
Give me the daggers.
The sleeping and the dead
Are but as pictures.
'Tis the eye of childhood
That fears a painted devil.
If he do bleed,
I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal,
For it must seem their guilt.
[She exits with the daggers.
Knock within.]
MACBETH  Whence is that
knocking?
How is 't with me when every noise appalls me?
What hands are here!
Ha, they pluck out mine eyes.
Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood
Clean from my hand?
No, this my hand will rather
The multitudinous seas incarnadine,
Making the green one red.
[Enter Lady Macbeth.]
LADY MACBETH
My hands are of your color, but I shame
To wear a heart so white.
[Knock.]
I hear a knocking
At the south entry.
Retire we to our chamber.
A little water clears us of this deed.
How easy is it, then!
Your constancy
Hath left you unattended.
[Knock.]
Hark, more knocking.
Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us
And show us to be watchers.
Be not lost
So poorly in your thoughts.
MACBETH
To know my deed 'twere best not know myself.
[Knock.]
Wake Duncan with thy knocking.
I would thou
couldst.
[They exit.]
Scene 3
=======
[Knocking within.
Enter a Porter.]
PORTER  Here's a knocking indeed!
If a man were
porter of hell gate, he should have old turning the
key.
[(Knock.)]
Knock, knock, knock!
Who's there, i'
th' name of Beelzebub?
Here's a farmer that hanged
himself on th' expectation of plenty.
Come in time!
Have napkins enough about you; here you'll sweat
for 't.
[(Knock.)]
Knock, knock!
Who's there, in th'
other devil's name?
Faith, here's an equivocator
that could swear in both the scales against either
scale, who committed treason enough for God's
sake yet could not equivocate to heaven.
O, come in,
equivocator.
[(Knock.)]
Knock, knock, knock!
Who's
there?
Faith, here's an English tailor come hither for
stealing out of a French hose.
Come in, tailor.
Here
you may roast your goose.
[(Knock.)]
Knock, knock!
Never at quiet.--What are you?--But this place is
too cold for hell.
I'll devil-porter it no further.
I had
thought to have let in some of all professions that go
the primrose way to th' everlasting bonfire.
[(Knock.)]
Anon, anon!
[The Porter opens the door to Macduff and Lennox.]
I pray you, remember the porter.
MACDUFF
Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed
That you do lie so late?
PORTER  Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second
cock, and drink, sir, is a great provoker of three
things.
MACDUFF  What three things does drink especially
provoke?
PORTER  Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine.
Lechery, sir, it provokes and unprovokes.
It provokes
the desire, but it takes away the performance.
Therefore much drink may be said to be an
equivocator with lechery.
It makes him, and it
mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it
persuades him and disheartens him; makes him
stand to and not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates
him in a sleep and, giving him the lie, leaves
him.
MACDUFF  I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
PORTER  That it did, sir, i' th' very throat on me; but I
requited him for his lie, and, I think, being too
strong for him, though he took up my legs sometime,
yet I made a shift to cast him.
MACDUFF  Is thy master stirring?
[Enter Macbeth.]
Our knocking has awaked him.
Here he comes.
[Porter exits.]
LENNOX
Good morrow, noble sir.
MACBETH  Good morrow, both.
MACDUFF
Is the King stirring, worthy thane?
MACBETH  Not yet.
MACDUFF
He did command me to call timely on him.
I have almost slipped the hour.
MACBETH  I'll bring you to him.
MACDUFF
I know this is a joyful trouble to you,
But yet 'tis one.
MACBETH
The labor we delight in physics pain.
This is the door.
MACDUFF  I'll make so bold to call,
For 'tis my limited service.
[Macduff exits.]
LENNOX  Goes the King hence today?
MACBETH  He does.
He did appoint so.
LENNOX
The night has been unruly.
Where we lay,
Our chimneys were blown down and, as they say,
Lamentings heard i' th' air, strange screams of
death,
And prophesying, with accents terrible,
Of dire combustion and confused events
New hatched to th' woeful time.
The obscure bird
Clamored the livelong night.
Some say the Earth
Was feverous and did shake.
MACBETH  'Twas a rough night.
LENNOX
My young remembrance cannot parallel
A fellow to it.
[Enter Macduff.]
MACDUFF  O horror, horror, horror!
Tongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee!
MACBETH AND LENNOX  What's the matter?
MACDUFF
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece.
Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
The Lord's anointed temple and stole thence
The life o' th' building.
MACBETH  What is 't you say?
The life?
LENNOX  Mean you his Majesty?
MACDUFF
Approach the chamber and destroy your sight
With a new Gorgon.
Do not bid me speak.
See and then speak yourselves.
[Macbeth and Lennox exit.]
Awake, awake!
Ring the alarum bell.--Murder and treason!
Banquo and Donalbain, Malcolm, awake!
Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,
And look on death itself.
Up, up, and see
The great doom's image.
Malcolm, Banquo,
As from your graves rise up and walk like sprites
To countenance this horror.--Ring the bell.
[Bell rings.]
[Enter Lady Macbeth.]
LADY MACBETH  What's the business,
That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
The sleepers of the house?
Speak, speak!
MACDUFF  O gentle lady,
'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak.
The repetition in a woman's ear
Would murder as it fell.
[Enter Banquo.]
O Banquo, Banquo,
Our royal master's murdered.
LADY MACBETH  Woe, alas!
What, in our house?
BANQUO  Too cruel anywhere.--
Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself
And say it is not so.
[Enter Macbeth, Lennox, and Ross.]
MACBETH
Had I but died an hour before this chance,
I had lived a blessed time; for from this instant
There's nothing serious in mortality.
All is but toys.
Renown and grace is dead.
The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees
Is left this vault to brag of.
[Enter Malcolm and Donalbain.]
DONALBAIN  What is amiss?
MACBETH  You are, and do not know 't.
The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood
Is stopped; the very source of it is stopped.
MACDUFF
Your royal father's murdered.
MALCOLM  O, by whom?
LENNOX
Those of his chamber, as it seemed, had done 't.
Their hands and faces were all badged with blood.
So were their daggers, which unwiped we found
Upon their pillows.
They stared and were distracted.
No man's life was to be trusted with them.
MACBETH
O, yet I do repent me of my fury,
That I did kill them.
MACDUFF  Wherefore did you so?
MACBETH
Who can be wise, amazed, temp'rate, and furious,
Loyal, and neutral, in a moment?
No man.
Th' expedition of my violent love
Outrun the pauser, reason.
Here lay Duncan,
His silver skin laced with his golden blood,
And his gashed stabs looked like a breach in nature
For ruin's wasteful entrance; there the murderers,
Steeped in the colors of their trade, their daggers
Unmannerly breeched with gore.
Who could refrain
That had a heart to love, and in that heart
Courage to make 's love known?
LADY MACBETH  Help me hence, ho!
MACDUFF
Look to the lady.
MALCOLM, [aside to Donalbain]  Why do we hold our
tongues,
That most may claim this argument for ours?
DONALBAIN, [aside to Malcolm]
What should be spoken here, where our fate,
Hid in an auger hole, may rush and seize us?
Let's away.
Our tears are not yet brewed.
MALCOLM, [aside to Donalbain]
Nor our strong sorrow upon the foot of motion.
BANQUO  Look to the lady.
[Lady Macbeth is assisted to leave.]
And when we have our naked frailties hid,
That suffer in exposure, let us meet
And question this most bloody piece of work
To know it further.
Fears and scruples shake us.
In the great hand of God I stand, and thence
Against the undivulged pretense I fight
Of treasonous malice.
MACDUFF  And so do I.
ALL  So all.
MACBETH
Let's briefly put on manly readiness
And meet i' th' hall together.
ALL  Well contented.
[All but Malcolm and Donalbain exit.]
MALCOLM
What will you do?
Let's not consort with them.
To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
Which the false man does easy.
I'll to England.
DONALBAIN
To Ireland I.
Our separated fortune
Shall keep us both the safer.
Where we are,
There's daggers in men's smiles.
The near in blood,
The nearer bloody.
MALCOLM  This murderous shaft that's shot
Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way
Is to avoid the aim.
Therefore to horse,
And let us not be dainty of leave-taking
But shift away.
There's warrant in that theft
Which steals itself when there's no mercy left.
[They exit.]
Scene 4
=======
[Enter Ross with an Old Man.]
OLD MAN
Threescore and ten I can remember well,
Within the volume of which time I have seen
Hours dreadful and things strange, but this sore
night
Hath trifled former knowings.
ROSS  Ha, good father,
Thou seest the heavens, as troubled with man's act,
Threatens his bloody stage.
By th' clock 'tis day,
And yet dark night strangles the traveling lamp.
Is 't night's predominance or the day's shame
That darkness does the face of earth entomb
When living light should kiss it?
OLD MAN  'Tis unnatural,
Even like the deed that's done.
On Tuesday last
A falcon, tow'ring in her pride of place,
Was by a mousing owl hawked at and killed.
ROSS
And Duncan's horses (a thing most strange and
certain),
Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,
Turned wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,
Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would
Make war with mankind.
OLD MAN  'Tis said they eat each
other.
ROSS
They did so, to th' amazement of mine eyes
That looked upon 't.
[Enter Macduff.]
Here comes the good
Macduff.--
How goes the world, sir, now?
MACDUFF  Why, see you not?
ROSS
Is 't known who did this more than bloody deed?
MACDUFF
Those that Macbeth hath slain.
ROSS  Alas the day,
What good could they pretend?
MACDUFF  They were suborned.
Malcolm and Donalbain, the King's two sons,
Are stol'n away and fled, which puts upon them
Suspicion of the deed.
ROSS  'Gainst nature still!
Thriftless ambition, that will ravin up
Thine own lives' means.
Then 'tis most like
The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.
MACDUFF
He is already named and gone to Scone
To be invested.
ROSS  Where is Duncan's body?
MACDUFF  Carried to Colmekill,
The sacred storehouse of his predecessors
And guardian of their bones.
ROSS  Will you to Scone?
MACDUFF
No, cousin, I'll to Fife.
ROSS  Well, I will thither.
MACDUFF
Well, may you see things well done there.
Adieu,
Lest our old robes sit easier than our new.
ROSS  Farewell, father.
OLD MAN
God's benison go with you and with those
That would make good of bad and friends of foes.
[All exit.]
ACT 3
=====

Scene 1
=======
[Enter Banquo.]
BANQUO
Thou hast it now--king, Cawdor, Glamis, all
As the Weird Women promised, and I fear
Thou played'st most foully for 't.
Yet it was said
It should not stand in thy posterity,
But that myself should be the root and father
Of many kings.
If there come truth from them
(As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine)
Why, by the verities on thee made good,
May they not be my oracles as well,
And set me up in hope?
But hush, no more.
[Sennet sounded.
Enter Macbeth as King, Lady
Macbeth, Lennox, Ross, Lords, and Attendants.]
MACBETH
Here's our chief guest.
LADY MACBETH  If he had been forgotten,
It had been as a gap in our great feast
And all-thing unbecoming.
MACBETH
Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir,
And I'll request your presence.
BANQUO  Let your Highness
Command upon me, to the which my duties
Are with a most indissoluble tie
Forever knit.
MACBETH  Ride you this afternoon?
BANQUO  Ay, my good lord.
MACBETH
We should have else desired your good advice
(Which still hath been both grave and prosperous)
In this day's council, but we'll take tomorrow.
Is 't far you ride?
BANQUO
As far, my lord, as will fill up the time
'Twixt this and supper.
Go not my horse the better,
I must become a borrower of the night
For a dark hour or twain.
MACBETH  Fail not our feast.
BANQUO  My lord, I will not.
MACBETH
We hear our bloody cousins are bestowed
In England and in Ireland, not confessing
Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers
With strange invention.
But of that tomorrow,
When therewithal we shall have cause of state
Craving us jointly.
Hie you to horse.
Adieu,
Till you return at night.
Goes Fleance with you?
BANQUO
Ay, my good lord.
Our time does call upon 's.
MACBETH
I wish your horses swift and sure of foot,
And so I do commend you to their backs.
Farewell.
[Banquo exits.]
Let every man be master of his time
Till seven at night.
To make society
The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself
Till suppertime alone.
While then, God be with you.
[Lords and all but Macbeth and a Servant exit.]
Sirrah, a word with you.
Attend those men
Our pleasure?
SERVANT
They are, my lord, without the palace gate.
MACBETH
Bring them before us.
[Servant exits.]
To be thus is nothing,
But to be safely thus.
Our fears in Banquo
Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature
Reigns that which would be feared.
'Tis much he
dares,
And to that dauntless temper of his mind
He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor
To act in safety.
There is none but he
Whose being I do fear; and under him
My genius is rebuked, as it is said
Mark Antony's was by Caesar.
He chid the sisters
When first they put the name of king upon me
And bade them speak to him.
Then, prophet-like,
They hailed him father to a line of kings.
Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown
And put a barren scepter in my grip,
Thence to be wrenched with an unlineal hand,
No son of mine succeeding.
If 't be so,
For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;
For them the gracious Duncan have I murdered,
Put rancors in the vessel of my peace
Only for them, and mine eternal jewel
Given to the common enemy of man
To make them kings, the seeds of Banquo kings.
Rather than so, come fate into the list,
And champion me to th' utterance.--Who's there?
[Enter Servant and two Murderers.]
[To the Servant.]
Now go to the door, and stay there
till we call.
[Servant exits.]
Was it not yesterday we spoke together?
MURDERERS
It was, so please your Highness.
MACBETH  Well then, now
Have you considered of my speeches?
Know
That it was he, in the times past, which held you
So under fortune, which you thought had been
Our innocent self.
This I made good to you
In our last conference, passed in probation with you
How you were borne in hand, how crossed, the
instruments,
Who wrought with them, and all things else that
might
To half a soul and to a notion crazed
Say "Thus did Banquo."
FIRST MURDERER  You made it known to us.
MACBETH
I did so, and went further, which is now
Our point of second meeting.
Do you find
Your patience so predominant in your nature
That you can let this go?
Are you so gospeled
To pray for this good man and for his issue,
Whose heavy hand hath bowed you to the grave
And beggared yours forever?
FIRST MURDERER  We are men, my liege.
MACBETH
Ay, in the catalogue you go for men,
As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels,
curs,
Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clept
All by the name of dogs.
The valued file
Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,
The housekeeper, the hunter, every one
According to the gift which bounteous nature
Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive
Particular addition, from the bill
That writes them all alike.
And so of men.
Now, if you have a station in the file,
Not i' th' worst rank of manhood, say 't,
And I will put that business in your bosoms
Whose execution takes your enemy off,
Grapples you to the heart and love of us,
Who wear our health but sickly in his life,
Which in his death were perfect.
SECOND MURDERER  I am one, my liege,
Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
Hath so incensed that I am reckless what
I do to spite the world.
FIRST MURDERER  And I another
So weary with disasters, tugged with fortune,
That I would set my life on any chance,
To mend it or be rid on 't.
MACBETH  Both of you
Know Banquo was your enemy.
MURDERERS  True, my lord.
MACBETH
So is he mine, and in such bloody distance
That every minute of his being thrusts
Against my near'st of life.
And though I could
With barefaced power sweep him from my sight
And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,
For certain friends that are both his and mine,
Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall
Who I myself struck down.
And thence it is
That I to your assistance do make love,
Masking the business from the common eye
For sundry weighty reasons.
SECOND MURDERER  We shall, my lord,
Perform what you command us.
FIRST MURDERER  Though our lives--

MACBETH
Your spirits shine through you.
Within this hour at
most
I will advise you where to plant yourselves,
Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' th' time,
The moment on 't, for 't must be done tonight
And something from the palace; always thought
That I require a clearness.
And with him
(To leave no rubs nor botches in the work)
Fleance, his son, that keeps him company,
Whose absence is no less material to me
Than is his father's, must embrace the fate
Of that dark hour.
Resolve yourselves apart.
I'll come to you anon.
MURDERERS  We are resolved, my lord.
MACBETH
I'll call upon you straight.
Abide within.
[Murderers exit.]
It is concluded.
Banquo, thy soul's flight,
If it find heaven, must find it out tonight.
[He exits.]
Scene 2
=======
[Enter Macbeth's Lady and a Servant.]
LADY MACBETH  Is Banquo gone from court?
SERVANT
Ay, madam, but returns again tonight.
LADY MACBETH
Say to the King I would attend his leisure
For a few words.
SERVANT  Madam, I will.
[He exits.]
LADY MACBETH  Naught's had, all's spent,
Where our desire is got without content.
'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.
[Enter Macbeth.]
How now, my lord, why do you keep alone,
Of sorriest fancies your companions making,
Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
With them they think on?
Things without all remedy
Should be without regard.
What's done is done.
MACBETH
We have scorched the snake, not killed it.
She'll close and be herself whilst our poor malice
Remains in danger of her former tooth.
But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds
suffer,
Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep
In the affliction of these terrible dreams
That shake us nightly.
Better be with the dead,
Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,
Than on the torture of the mind to lie
In restless ecstasy.
Duncan is in his grave.
After life's fitful fever he sleeps well.
Treason has done his worst; nor steel nor poison,
Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing
Can touch him further.
LADY MACBETH  Come on, gentle my lord,
Sleek o'er your rugged looks.
Be bright and jovial
Among your guests tonight.
MACBETH  So shall I, love,
And so I pray be you.
Let your remembrance
Apply to Banquo; present him eminence
Both with eye and tongue: unsafe the while that we
Must lave our honors in these flattering streams
And make our faces vizards to our hearts,
Disguising what they are.
LADY MACBETH  You must leave this.
MACBETH
O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!
Thou know'st that Banquo and his Fleance lives.
LADY MACBETH
But in them nature's copy's not eterne.
MACBETH
There's comfort yet; they are assailable.
Then be thou jocund.
Ere the bat hath flown
His cloistered flight, ere to black Hecate's summons
The shard-born beetle with his drowsy hums
Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done
A deed of dreadful note.
LADY MACBETH  What's to be done?
MACBETH
Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
Till thou applaud the deed.--Come, seeling night,
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day
And with thy bloody and invisible hand
Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
Which keeps me pale.
Light thickens, and the crow
Makes wing to th' rooky wood.
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse,
Whiles night's black agents to their preys do
rouse.--
Thou marvel'st at my words, but hold thee still.
Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
So prithee go with me.
[They exit.]
Scene 3
=======
[Enter three Murderers.]
FIRST MURDERER
But who did bid thee join with us?
THIRD MURDERER  Macbeth.
SECOND MURDERER, [to the First Murderer]
He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers
Our offices and what we have to do
To the direction just.
FIRST MURDERER  Then stand with us.--
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day.
Now spurs the lated traveler apace
To gain the timely inn, and near approaches
The subject of our watch.
THIRD MURDERER  Hark, I hear horses.
BANQUO, [within]  Give us a light there, ho!
SECOND MURDERER  Then 'tis he.
The rest
That are within the note of expectation
Already are i' th' court.
FIRST MURDERER  His horses go about.
THIRD MURDERER
Almost a mile; but he does usually
(So all men do) from hence to th' palace gate
Make it their walk.
[Enter Banquo and Fleance, with a torch.]
SECOND MURDERER  A light, a light!
THIRD MURDERER  'Tis he.
FIRST MURDERER  Stand to 't.
BANQUO, [to Fleance]  It will be rain tonight.
FIRST MURDERER  Let it come down!
[The three Murderers attack.]
BANQUO
O treachery!
Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
Thou mayst revenge--O slave!
[He dies.
Fleance exits.]
THIRD MURDERER
Who did strike out the light?
FIRST MURDERER  Was 't not the way?
THIRD MURDERER  There's but one down.
The son is
fled.
SECOND MURDERER  We have lost best half of our
affair.
FIRST MURDERER
Well, let's away and say how much is done.
[They exit.]
Scene 4
=======
[Banquet prepared.
Enter Macbeth, Lady Macbeth,
Ross, Lennox, Lords, and Attendants.]
MACBETH
You know your own degrees; sit down.
At first
And last, the hearty welcome.
[They sit.]
LORDS  Thanks to your Majesty.
MACBETH
Ourself will mingle with society
And play the humble host.
Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time
We will require her welcome.
LADY MACBETH
Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends,
For my heart speaks they are welcome.
[Enter First Murderer to the door.]
MACBETH
See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.
Both sides are even.
Here I'll sit i' th' midst.
Be large in mirth.
Anon we'll drink a measure
The table round.
[He approaches the Murderer.]
There's
blood upon thy face.
MURDERER  'Tis Banquo's then.
MACBETH
'Tis better thee without than he within.
Is he dispatched?
MURDERER
My lord, his throat is cut.
That I did for him.
MACBETH
Thou art the best o' th' cutthroats,
Yet he's good that did the like for Fleance.
If thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil.
MURDERER
Most royal sir, Fleance is 'scaped.
MACBETH, [aside]
Then comes my fit again.
I had else been perfect,
Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,
As broad and general as the casing air.
But now I am cabined, cribbed, confined, bound in
To saucy doubts and fears.--But Banquo's safe?
MURDERER
Ay, my good lord.
Safe in a ditch he bides,
With twenty trenched gashes on his head,
The least a death to nature.
MACBETH  Thanks for that.
There the grown serpent lies.
The worm that's fled
Hath nature that in time will venom breed,
No teeth for th' present.
Get thee gone.
Tomorrow
We'll hear ourselves again.
[Murderer exits.]
LADY MACBETH  My royal lord,
You do not give the cheer.
The feast is sold
That is not often vouched, while 'tis a-making,
'Tis given with welcome.
To feed were best at home;
From thence, the sauce to meat is ceremony;
Meeting were bare without it.
[Enter the Ghost of Banquo, and sits in Macbeth's place.]
MACBETH, [to Lady Macbeth]  Sweet remembrancer!--
Now, good digestion wait on appetite
And health on both!
LENNOX  May 't please your Highness sit.
MACBETH
Here had we now our country's honor roofed,
Were the graced person of our Banquo present,
Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
Than pity for mischance.
ROSS  His absence, sir,
Lays blame upon his promise.
Please 't your
Highness
To grace us with your royal company?
MACBETH
The table's full.
LENNOX  Here is a place reserved, sir.
MACBETH  Where?
LENNOX
Here, my good lord.
What is 't that moves your
Highness?
MACBETH
Which of you have done this?
LORDS  What, my good lord?
MACBETH, [to the Ghost]
Thou canst not say I did it.
Never shake
Thy gory locks at me.
ROSS
Gentlemen, rise.
His Highness is not well.
LADY MACBETH
Sit, worthy friends.
My lord is often thus
And hath been from his youth.
Pray you, keep seat.
The fit is momentary; upon a thought
He will again be well.
If much you note him
You shall offend him and extend his passion.
Feed and regard him not.
[Drawing Macbeth aside.]
Are you a man?
MACBETH
Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that
Which might appall the devil.
LADY MACBETH  O, proper stuff!
This is the very painting of your fear.
This is the air-drawn dagger which you said
Led you to Duncan.
O, these flaws and starts,
Impostors to true fear, would well become
A woman's story at a winter's fire,
Authorized by her grandam.
Shame itself!
Why do you make such faces?
When all's done,
You look but on a stool.
MACBETH
Prithee, see there.
Behold, look!
[To the Ghost.]
Lo,
how say you?
Why, what care I?
If thou canst nod, speak too.--
If charnel houses and our graves must send
Those that we bury back, our monuments
Shall be the maws of kites.
[Ghost exits.]
LADY MACBETH  What, quite unmanned in folly?
MACBETH
If I stand here, I saw him.
LADY MACBETH  Fie, for shame!
MACBETH
Blood hath been shed ere now, i' th' olden time,
Ere humane statute purged the gentle weal;
Ay, and since too, murders have been performed
Too terrible for the ear.
The time has been
That, when the brains were out, the man would die,
And there an end.
But now they rise again
With twenty mortal murders on their crowns
And push us from our stools.
This is more strange
Than such a murder is.
LADY MACBETH  My worthy lord,
Your noble friends do lack you.
MACBETH  I do forget.--
Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends.
I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing
To those that know me.
Come, love and health to
all.
Then I'll sit down.--Give me some wine.
Fill full.
[Enter Ghost.]
I drink to th' general joy o' th' whole table
And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss.
Would he were here!
To all, and him we thirst,
And all to all.
LORDS  Our duties, and the pledge.
[They raise their drinking cups.]
MACBETH, [to the Ghost]
Avaunt, and quit my sight!
Let the earth hide thee.
Thy bones are marrowless; thy blood is cold;
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
Which thou dost glare with.
LADY MACBETH  Think of this, good
peers,
But as a thing of custom.
'Tis no other;
Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.
MACBETH, [to the Ghost]  What man dare, I dare.
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,
The armed rhinoceros, or th' Hyrcan tiger;
Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves
Shall never tremble.
Or be alive again
And dare me to the desert with thy sword.
If trembling I inhabit then, protest me
The baby of a girl.
Hence, horrible shadow!
Unreal mock'ry, hence!
[Ghost exits.]
Why so, being gone,
I am a man again.--Pray you sit still.
LADY MACBETH
You have displaced the mirth, broke the good
meeting
With most admired disorder.
MACBETH  Can such things be
And overcome us like a summer's cloud,
Without our special wonder?
You make me strange
Even to the disposition that I owe
When now I think you can behold such sights
And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks
When mine is blanched with fear.
ROSS  What sights, my
lord?
LADY MACBETH
I pray you, speak not.
He grows worse and worse.
Question enrages him.
At once, good night.
Stand not upon the order of your going,
But go at once.
LENNOX  Good night, and better health
Attend his Majesty.
LADY MACBETH  A kind good night to all.
[Lords and all but Macbeth and Lady Macbeth exit.]
MACBETH
It will have blood, they say; blood will have blood.
Stones have been known to move, and trees to
speak.
Augurs and understood relations have
By maggot pies and choughs and rooks brought
forth
The secret'st man of blood.--What is the night?
LADY MACBETH
Almost at odds with morning, which is which.
MACBETH
How say'st thou that Macduff denies his person
At our great bidding?
LADY MACBETH  Did you send to him, sir?
MACBETH
I hear it by the way; but I will send.
There's not a one of them but in his house
I keep a servant fee'd.
I will tomorrow
(And betimes I will) to the Weird Sisters.
More shall they speak, for now I am bent to know
By the worst means the worst.
For mine own good,
All causes shall give way.
I am in blood
Stepped in so far that, should I wade no more,
Returning were as tedious as go o'er.
Strange things I have in head that will to hand,
Which must be acted ere they may be scanned.
LADY MACBETH
You lack the season of all natures, sleep.
MACBETH
Come, we'll to sleep.
My strange and self-abuse
Is the initiate fear that wants hard use.
We are yet but young in deed.
[They exit.]
Scene 5
=======
[Thunder.
Enter the three Witches, meeting Hecate.]
FIRST WITCH
Why, how now, Hecate?
You look angerly.
HECATE
Have I not reason, beldams as you are?
Saucy and overbold, how did you dare
To trade and traffic with Macbeth
In riddles and affairs of death,
And I, the mistress of your charms,
The close contriver of all harms,
Was never called to bear my part
Or show the glory of our art?
And which is worse, all you have done
Hath been but for a wayward son,
Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,
Loves for his own ends, not for you.
But make amends now.
Get you gone,
And at the pit of Acheron
Meet me i' th' morning.
Thither he
Will come to know his destiny.
Your vessels and your spells provide,
Your charms and everything beside.
I am for th' air.
This night I'll spend
Unto a dismal and a fatal end.
Great business must be wrought ere noon.
Upon the corner of the moon
There hangs a vap'rous drop profound.
I'll catch it ere it come to ground,
And that, distilled by magic sleights,
Shall raise such artificial sprites
As by the strength of their illusion
Shall draw him on to his confusion.
He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear
His hopes 'bove wisdom, grace, and fear.
And you all know, security
Is mortals' chiefest enemy.
[Music and a song.]
Hark!
I am called.
My little spirit, see,
Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me.
[Hecate exits.]
[Sing within "Come away, come away," etc.]
FIRST WITCH
Come, let's make haste.
She'll soon be back again.
[They exit.]
Scene 6
=======
[Enter Lennox and another Lord.]
LENNOX
My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,
Which can interpret farther.
Only I say
Things have been strangely borne.
The gracious
Duncan
Was pitied of Macbeth; marry, he was dead.
And the right valiant Banquo walked too late,
Whom you may say, if 't please you, Fleance killed,
For Fleance fled.
Men must not walk too late.
Who cannot want the thought how monstrous
It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
To kill their gracious father?
Damned fact,
How it did grieve Macbeth!
Did he not straight
In pious rage the two delinquents tear
That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
Was not that nobly done?
Ay, and wisely, too,
For 'twould have angered any heart alive
To hear the men deny 't.
So that I say
He has borne all things well.
And I do think
That had he Duncan's sons under his key
(As, an 't please heaven, he shall not) they should
find
What 'twere to kill a father.
So should Fleance.
But peace.
For from broad words, and 'cause he
failed
His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear
Macduff lives in disgrace.
Sir, can you tell
Where he bestows himself?
LORD  The son of Duncan
(From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth)
Lives in the English court and is received
Of the most pious Edward with such grace
That the malevolence of fortune nothing
Takes from his high respect.
Thither Macduff
Is gone to pray the holy king upon his aid
To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward
That, by the help of these (with Him above
To ratify the work), we may again
Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,
Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,
Do faithful homage, and receive free honors,
All which we pine for now.
And this report
Hath so exasperate the King that he
Prepares for some attempt of war.
LENNOX  Sent he to Macduff?
LORD
He did, and with an absolute "Sir, not I,"
The cloudy messenger turns me his back
And hums, as who should say "You'll rue the time
That clogs me with this answer."
LENNOX  And that well might
Advise him to a caution t' hold what distance
His wisdom can provide.
Some holy angel
Fly to the court of England and unfold
His message ere he come, that a swift blessing
May soon return to this our suffering country
Under a hand accursed.
LORD  I'll send my prayers with him.
[They exit.]
ACT 4
=====

Scene 1
=======
[Thunder.
Enter the three Witches.]
FIRST WITCH
Thrice the brinded cat hath mewed.
SECOND WITCH
Thrice, and once the hedge-pig whined.
THIRD WITCH
Harpier cries "'Tis time, 'tis time!"
FIRST WITCH
Round about the cauldron go;
In the poisoned entrails throw.
Toad, that under cold stone
Days and nights has thirty-one
Sweltered venom sleeping got,
Boil thou first i' th' charmed pot.
[The Witches circle the cauldron.]
ALL
Double, double toil and trouble;
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.
SECOND WITCH
Fillet of a fenny snake
In the cauldron boil and bake.
Eye of newt and toe of frog,
Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
Adder's fork and blindworm's sting,
Lizard's leg and howlet's wing,
For a charm of powerful trouble,
Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.
ALL
Double, double toil and trouble;
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.
THIRD WITCH
Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,
Witch's mummy, maw and gulf
Of the ravined salt-sea shark,
Root of hemlock digged i' th' dark,
Liver of blaspheming Jew,
Gall of goat and slips of yew
Slivered in the moon's eclipse,
Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips,
Finger of birth-strangled babe
Ditch-delivered by a drab,
Make the gruel thick and slab.
Add thereto a tiger's chaudron
For th' ingredience of our cauldron.
ALL
Double, double toil and trouble;
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.
SECOND WITCH
Cool it with a baboon's blood.
Then the charm is firm and good.
[Enter Hecate to the other three Witches.]
HECATE
O, well done!
I commend your pains,
And everyone shall share i' th' gains.
And now about the cauldron sing
Like elves and fairies in a ring,
Enchanting all that you put in.
[Music and a song: "Black Spirits," etc.
Hecate exits.]
SECOND WITCH
By the pricking of my thumbs,
Something wicked this way comes.
Open, locks,
Whoever knocks.
[Enter Macbeth.]
MACBETH
How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags?
What is 't you do?
ALL  A deed without a name.
MACBETH
I conjure you by that which you profess
(Howe'er you come to know it), answer me.
Though you untie the winds and let them fight
Against the churches, though the yeasty waves
Confound and swallow navigation up,
Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown
down,
Though castles topple on their warders' heads,
Though palaces and pyramids do slope
Their heads to their foundations, though the
treasure
Of nature's germens tumble all together
Even till destruction sicken, answer me
To what I ask you.
FIRST WITCH  Speak.
SECOND WITCH  Demand.
THIRD WITCH  We'll answer.
FIRST WITCH
Say if th' hadst rather hear it from our mouths
Or from our masters'.
MACBETH  Call 'em.
Let me see 'em.
FIRST WITCH
Pour in sow's blood that hath eaten
Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten
From the murderers' gibbet throw
Into the flame.
ALL  Come high or low;
Thyself and office deftly show.
[Thunder.
First Apparition, an Armed Head.]
MACBETH
Tell me, thou unknown power--

FIRST WITCH  He knows thy
thought.
Hear his speech but say thou naught.
FIRST APPARITION
Macbeth!
Macbeth!
Macbeth!
Beware Macduff!
Beware the Thane of Fife!
Dismiss me.
Enough.
[He descends.]
MACBETH
Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks.
Thou hast harped my fear aright.
But one word
more--

FIRST WITCH
He will not be commanded.
Here's another
More potent than the first.
[Thunder.
Second Apparition, a Bloody Child.]
SECOND APPARITION  Macbeth!
Macbeth!
Macbeth!--

MACBETH  Had I three ears, I'd hear thee.
SECOND APPARITION
Be bloody, bold, and resolute.
Laugh to scorn
The power of man, for none of woman born
Shall harm Macbeth.
[He descends.]
MACBETH
Then live, Macduff; what need I fear of thee?
But yet I'll make assurance double sure
And take a bond of fate.
Thou shalt not live,
That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,
And sleep in spite of thunder.
[Thunder.
Third Apparition, a Child Crowned, with a tree
in his hand.]
What is this
That rises like the issue of a king
And wears upon his baby brow the round
And top of sovereignty?
ALL  Listen but speak not to 't.
THIRD APPARITION
Be lion-mettled, proud, and take no care
Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are.
Macbeth shall never vanquished be until
Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane Hill
Shall come against him.
[He descends.]
MACBETH  That will never be.
Who can impress the forest, bid the tree
Unfix his earthbound root?
Sweet bodements, good!
Rebellious dead, rise never till the Wood
Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth
Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath
To time and mortal custom.
Yet my heart
Throbs to know one thing.
Tell me, if your art
Can tell so much: shall Banquo's issue ever
Reign in this kingdom?
ALL  Seek to know no more.
MACBETH
I will be satisfied.
Deny me this,
And an eternal curse fall on you!
Let me know!
[Cauldron sinks.
Hautboys.]
Why sinks that cauldron?
And what noise is this?
FIRST WITCH  Show.
SECOND WITCH  Show.
THIRD WITCH  Show.
ALL
Show his eyes and grieve his heart.
Come like shadows; so depart.
[A show of eight kings, the eighth king with a glass in
his hand, and Banquo last.]
MACBETH
Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo.
Down!
Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs.
And thy hair,
Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.
A third is like the former.--Filthy hags,
Why do you show me this?--A fourth?
Start, eyes!
What, will the line stretch out to th' crack of doom?
Another yet?
A seventh?
I'll see no more.
And yet the eighth appears who bears a glass
Which shows me many more, and some I see
That twofold balls and treble scepters carry.
Horrible sight!
Now I see 'tis true,
For the blood-boltered Banquo smiles upon me
And points at them for his.
[The Apparitions disappear.]
What, is this so?
FIRST WITCH
Ay, sir, all this is so.
But why
Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites
And show the best of our delights.
I'll charm the air to give a sound
While you perform your antic round,
That this great king may kindly say
Our duties did his welcome pay.
[Music.
The Witches dance and vanish.]
MACBETH
Where are they?
Gone?
Let this pernicious hour
Stand aye accursed in the calendar!--
Come in, without there.
[Enter Lennox.]
LENNOX  What's your Grace's will?
MACBETH
Saw you the Weird Sisters?
LENNOX  No, my lord.
MACBETH
Came they not by you?
LENNOX  No, indeed, my lord.
MACBETH
Infected be the air whereon they ride,
And damned all those that trust them!
I did hear
The galloping of horse.
Who was 't came by?
LENNOX
'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word
Macduff is fled to England.
MACBETH  Fled to England?
LENNOX  Ay, my good lord.
MACBETH, [aside]
Time, thou anticipat'st my dread exploits.
The flighty purpose never is o'ertook
Unless the deed go with it.
From this moment
The very firstlings of my heart shall be
The firstlings of my hand.
And even now,
To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and
done:
The castle of Macduff I will surprise,
Seize upon Fife, give to th' edge o' th' sword
His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls
That trace him in his line.
No boasting like a fool;
This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.
But no more sights!--Where are these gentlemen?
Come bring me where they are.
[They exit.]
Scene 2
=======
[Enter Macduff's Wife, her Son, and Ross.]
LADY MACDUFF
What had he done to make him fly the land?
ROSS
You must have patience, madam.
LADY MACDUFF  He had none.
His flight was madness.
When our actions do not,
Our fears do make us traitors.
ROSS  You know not
Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.
LADY MACDUFF
Wisdom?
To leave his wife, to leave his babes,
His mansion and his titles in a place
From whence himself does fly?
He loves us not;
He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren,
The most diminutive of birds, will fight,
Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
All is the fear, and nothing is the love,
As little is the wisdom, where the flight
So runs against all reason.
ROSS  My dearest coz,
I pray you school yourself.
But for your husband,
He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows
The fits o' th' season.
I dare not speak much
further;
But cruel are the times when we are traitors
And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumor
From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,
But float upon a wild and violent sea
Each way and move--I take my leave of you.
Shall not be long but I'll be here again.
Things at the worst will cease or else climb upward
To what they were before.--My pretty cousin,
Blessing upon you.
LADY MACDUFF
Fathered he is, and yet he's fatherless.
ROSS
I am so much a fool, should I stay longer
It would be my disgrace and your discomfort.
I take my leave at once.
[Ross exits.]
LADY MACDUFF  Sirrah, your father's dead.
And what will you do now?
How will you live?
SON
As birds do, mother.
LADY MACDUFF  What, with worms and flies?
SON
With what I get, I mean; and so do they.
LADY MACDUFF
Poor bird, thou 'dst never fear the net nor lime,
The pitfall nor the gin.
SON
Why should I, mother?
Poor birds they are not set
for.
My father is not dead, for all your saying.
LADY MACDUFF
Yes, he is dead.
How wilt thou do for a father?
SON  Nay, how will you do for a husband?
LADY MACDUFF
Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.
SON  Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.
LADY MACDUFF  Thou speak'st with all thy wit,
And yet, i' faith, with wit enough for thee.
SON  Was my father a traitor, mother?
LADY MACDUFF  Ay, that he was.
SON  What is a traitor?
LADY MACDUFF  Why, one that swears and lies.
SON  And be all traitors that do so?
LADY MACDUFF  Every one that does so is a traitor
and must be hanged.
SON  And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?
LADY MACDUFF  Every one.
SON  Who must hang them?
LADY MACDUFF  Why, the honest men.
SON  Then the liars and swearers are fools, for there
are liars and swearers enough to beat the honest
men and hang up them.
LADY MACDUFF  Now God help thee, poor monkey!
But
how wilt thou do for a father?
SON  If he were dead, you'd weep for him.
If you would
not, it were a good sign that I should quickly have a
new father.
LADY MACDUFF  Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!
[Enter a Messenger.]
MESSENGER
Bless you, fair dame.
I am not to you known,
Though in your state of honor I am perfect.
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly.
If you will take a homely man's advice,
Be not found here.
Hence with your little ones!
To fright you thus methinks I am too savage;
To do worse to you were fell cruelty,
Which is too nigh your person.
Heaven preserve
you!
I dare abide no longer.
[Messenger exits.]
LADY MACDUFF  Whither should I fly?
I have done no harm.
But I remember now
I am in this earthly world, where to do harm
Is often laudable, to do good sometime
Accounted dangerous folly.
Why then, alas,
Do I put up that womanly defense
To say I have done no harm?
[Enter Murderers.]
What are these faces?
MURDERER  Where is your husband?
LADY MACDUFF
I hope in no place so unsanctified
Where such as thou mayst find him.
MURDERER  He's a traitor.
SON
Thou liest, thou shag-eared villain!
MURDERER  What, you egg?
[Stabbing him.]
Young fry of treachery!
SON  He has killed
me, mother.
Run away, I pray you.
[Lady Macduff exits, crying "Murder!"
followed by the
Murderers bearing the Son's body.]
Scene 3
=======
[Enter Malcolm and Macduff.]
MALCOLM
Let us seek out some desolate shade and there
Weep our sad bosoms empty.
MACDUFF  Let us rather
Hold fast the mortal sword and, like good men,
Bestride our downfall'n birthdom.
Each new morn
New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows
Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds
As if it felt with Scotland, and yelled out
Like syllable of dolor.
MALCOLM  What I believe, I'll wail;
What know, believe; and what I can redress,
As I shall find the time to friend, I will.
What you have spoke, it may be so, perchance.
This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
Was once thought honest.
You have loved him well.
He hath not touched you yet.
I am young, but
something
You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom
To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb
T' appease an angry god.
MACDUFF
I am not treacherous.
MALCOLM  But Macbeth is.
A good and virtuous nature may recoil
In an imperial charge.
But I shall crave your
pardon.
That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose.
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.
Though all things foul would wear the brows of
grace,
Yet grace must still look so.
MACDUFF  I have lost my hopes.
MALCOLM
Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
Why in that rawness left you wife and child,
Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,
Without leave-taking?
I pray you,
Let not my jealousies be your dishonors,
But mine own safeties.
You may be rightly just,
Whatever I shall think.
MACDUFF  Bleed, bleed, poor country!
Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,
For goodness dare not check thee.
Wear thou thy
wrongs;
The title is affeered.--Fare thee well, lord.
I would not be the villain that thou think'st
For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,
And the rich East to boot.
MALCOLM  Be not offended.
I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke.
It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash
Is added to her wounds.
I think withal
There would be hands uplifted in my right;
And here from gracious England have I offer
Of goodly thousands.
But, for all this,
When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head
Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country
Shall have more vices than it had before,
More suffer, and more sundry ways than ever,
By him that shall succeed.
MACDUFF  What should he be?
MALCOLM
It is myself I mean, in whom I know
All the particulars of vice so grafted
That, when they shall be opened, black Macbeth
Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state
Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
With my confineless harms.
MACDUFF  Not in the legions
Of horrid hell can come a devil more damned
In evils to top Macbeth.
MALCOLM  I grant him bloody,
Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,
Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin
That has a name.
But there's no bottom, none,
In my voluptuousness.
Your wives, your daughters,
Your matrons, and your maids could not fill up
The cistern of my lust, and my desire
All continent impediments would o'erbear
That did oppose my will.
Better Macbeth
Than such an one to reign.
MACDUFF  Boundless intemperance
In nature is a tyranny.
It hath been
Th' untimely emptying of the happy throne
And fall of many kings.
But fear not yet
To take upon you what is yours.
You may
Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty
And yet seem cold--the time you may so hoodwink.
We have willing dames enough.
There cannot be
That vulture in you to devour so many
As will to greatness dedicate themselves,
Finding it so inclined.
MALCOLM  With this there grows
In my most ill-composed affection such
A stanchless avarice that, were I king,
I should cut off the nobles for their lands,
Desire his jewels, and this other's house;
And my more-having would be as a sauce
To make me hunger more, that I should forge
Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,
Destroying them for wealth.
MACDUFF  This avarice
Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root
Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been
The sword of our slain kings.
Yet do not fear.
Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will
Of your mere own.
All these are portable,
With other graces weighed.
MALCOLM
But I have none.
The king-becoming graces,
As justice, verity, temp'rance, stableness,
Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,
Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,
I have no relish of them but abound
In the division of each several crime,
Acting it many ways.
Nay, had I power, I should
Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,
Uproar the universal peace, confound
All unity on earth.
MACDUFF  O Scotland, Scotland!
MALCOLM
If such a one be fit to govern, speak.
I am as I have spoken.
MACDUFF  Fit to govern?
No, not to live.--O nation miserable,
With an untitled tyrant bloody-sceptered,
When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,
Since that the truest issue of thy throne
By his own interdiction stands accursed
And does blaspheme his breed?--Thy royal father
Was a most sainted king.
The queen that bore thee,
Oft'ner upon her knees than on her feet,
Died every day she lived.
Fare thee well.
These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself
Hath banished me from Scotland.--O my breast,
Thy hope ends here!
MALCOLM  Macduff, this noble passion,
Child of integrity, hath from my soul
Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts
To thy good truth and honor.
Devilish Macbeth
By many of these trains hath sought to win me
Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
From overcredulous haste.
But God above
Deal between thee and me, for even now
I put myself to thy direction and
Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure
The taints and blames I laid upon myself
For strangers to my nature.
I am yet
Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,
At no time broke my faith, would not betray
The devil to his fellow, and delight
No less in truth than life.
My first false speaking
Was this upon myself.
What I am truly
Is thine and my poor country's to command--
Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,
Old Siward with ten thousand warlike men,
Already at a point, was setting forth.
Now we'll together, and the chance of goodness
Be like our warranted quarrel.
Why are you silent?
MACDUFF
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
'Tis hard to reconcile.
[Enter a Doctor.]
MALCOLM  Well, more anon.--
Comes the King forth, I pray you?
DOCTOR
Ay, sir.
There are a crew of wretched souls
That stay his cure.
Their malady convinces
The great assay of art, but at his touch
(Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand)
They presently amend.
MALCOLM  I thank you, doctor.
[Doctor exits.]
MACDUFF
What's the disease he means?
MALCOLM  'Tis called the evil:
A most miraculous work in this good king,
Which often since my here-remain in England
I have seen him do.
How he solicits heaven
Himself best knows, but strangely visited people
All swoll'n and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,
The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
Put on with holy prayers; and, 'tis spoken,
To the succeeding royalty he leaves
The healing benediction.
With this strange virtue,
He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,
And sundry blessings hang about his throne
That speak him full of grace.
[Enter Ross.]
MACDUFF  See who comes here.
MALCOLM
My countryman, but yet I know him not.
MACDUFF
My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.
MALCOLM
I know him now.--Good God betimes remove
The means that makes us strangers!
ROSS  Sir, amen.
MACDUFF
Stands Scotland where it did?
ROSS  Alas, poor country,
Almost afraid to know itself.
It cannot
Be called our mother, but our grave, where nothing
But who knows nothing is once seen to smile;
Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rent the air
Are made, not marked; where violent sorrow seems
A modern ecstasy.
The dead man's knell
Is there scarce asked for who, and good men's lives
Expire before the flowers in their caps,
Dying or ere they sicken.
MACDUFF
O relation too nice and yet too true!
MALCOLM  What's the newest grief?
ROSS
That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker.
Each minute teems a new one.
MACDUFF  How does my wife?
ROSS  Why, well.
MACDUFF  And all my children?
ROSS  Well too.
MACDUFF
The tyrant has not battered at their peace?
ROSS
No, they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.
MACDUFF
Be not a niggard of your speech.
How goes 't?
ROSS
When I came hither to transport the tidings
Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumor
Of many worthy fellows that were out;
Which was to my belief witnessed the rather
For that I saw the tyrant's power afoot.
Now is the time of help.
Your eye in Scotland
Would create soldiers, make our women fight
To doff their dire distresses.
MALCOLM  Be 't their comfort
We are coming thither.
Gracious England hath
Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;
An older and a better soldier none
That Christendom gives out.
ROSS  Would I could answer
This comfort with the like.
But I have words
That would be howled out in the desert air,
Where hearing should not latch them.
MACDUFF  What concern
they--
The general cause, or is it a fee-grief
Due to some single breast?
ROSS  No mind that's honest
But in it shares some woe, though the main part
Pertains to you alone.
MACDUFF  If it be mine,
Keep it not from me.
Quickly let me have it.
ROSS
Let not your ears despise my tongue forever,
Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
That ever yet they heard.
MACDUFF  Hum!
I guess at it.
ROSS
Your castle is surprised, your wife and babes
Savagely slaughtered.
To relate the manner
Were on the quarry of these murdered deer
To add the death of you.
MALCOLM  Merciful heaven!--
What, man, ne'er pull your hat upon your brows.
Give sorrow words.
The grief that does not speak
Whispers the o'erfraught heart and bids it break.
MACDUFF  My children too?
ROSS
Wife, children, servants, all that could be found.
MACDUFF
And I must be from thence?
My wife killed too?
ROSS  I have said.
MALCOLM  Be comforted.
Let's make us med'cines of our great revenge
To cure this deadly grief.
MACDUFF
He has no children.
All my pretty ones?
Did you say "all"?
O hell-kite!
All?
What, all my pretty chickens and their dam
At one fell swoop?
MALCOLM  Dispute it like a man.
MACDUFF  I shall do so,
But I must also feel it as a man.
I cannot but remember such things were
That were most precious to me.
Did heaven look on
And would not take their part?
Sinful Macduff,
They were all struck for thee!
Naught that I am,
Not for their own demerits, but for mine,
Fell slaughter on their souls.
Heaven rest them now.
MALCOLM
Be this the whetstone of your sword.
Let grief
Convert to anger.
Blunt not the heart; enrage it.
MACDUFF
O, I could play the woman with mine eyes
And braggart with my tongue!
But, gentle heavens,
Cut short all intermission!
Front to front
Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself.
Within my sword's length set him.
If he 'scape,
Heaven forgive him too.
MALCOLM  This tune goes manly.
Come, go we to the King.
Our power is ready;
Our lack is nothing but our leave.
Macbeth
Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above
Put on their instruments.
Receive what cheer you
may.
The night is long that never finds the day.
[They exit.]
ACT 5
=====

Scene 1
=======
[Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman.]
DOCTOR  I have two nights watched with you but can
perceive no truth in your report.
When was it she
last walked?
GENTLEWOMAN  Since his Majesty went into the field, I
have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown
upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper,
fold it, write upon 't, read it, afterwards seal it, and
again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast
sleep.
DOCTOR  A great perturbation in nature, to receive at
once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of
watching.
In this slumb'ry agitation, besides her
walking and other actual performances, what at any
time have you heard her say?
GENTLEWOMAN  That, sir, which I will not report after
her.
DOCTOR  You may to me, and 'tis most meet you
should.
GENTLEWOMAN  Neither to you nor anyone, having no
witness to confirm my speech.
[Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper.]
Lo you, here she comes.
This is her very guise and,
upon my life, fast asleep.
Observe her; stand close.
DOCTOR  How came she by that light?
GENTLEWOMAN  Why, it stood by her.
She has light by
her continually.
'Tis her command.
DOCTOR  You see her eyes are open.
GENTLEWOMAN  Ay, but their sense are shut.
DOCTOR  What is it she does now?
Look how she rubs
her hands.
GENTLEWOMAN  It is an accustomed action with her to
seem thus washing her hands.
I have known her
continue in this a quarter of an hour.
LADY MACBETH  Yet here's a spot.
DOCTOR  Hark, she speaks.
I will set down what comes
from her, to satisfy my remembrance the more
strongly.
LADY MACBETH  Out, damned spot, out, I say!
One.
Two.
Why then, 'tis time to do 't.
Hell is murky.
Fie, my
lord, fie, a soldier and afeard?
What need we fear
who knows it, when none can call our power to
account?
Yet who would have thought the old man
to have had so much blood in him?
DOCTOR  Do you mark that?
LADY MACBETH  The Thane of Fife had a wife.
Where is
she now?
What, will these hands ne'er be clean?
No
more o' that, my lord, no more o' that.
You mar all
with this starting.
DOCTOR  Go to, go to.
You have known what you should
not.
GENTLEWOMAN  She has spoke what she should not,
I am sure of that.
Heaven knows what she has
known.
LADY MACBETH  Here's the smell of the blood still.
All
the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little
hand.
O, O, O!
DOCTOR  What a sigh is there!
The heart is sorely
charged.
GENTLEWOMAN  I would not have such a heart in my
bosom for the dignity of the whole body.
DOCTOR  Well, well, well.
GENTLEWOMAN  Pray God it be, sir.
DOCTOR  This disease is beyond my practice.
Yet I have
known those which have walked in their sleep,
who have died holily in their beds.
LADY MACBETH  Wash your hands.
Put on your nightgown.
Look not so pale.
I tell you yet again, Banquo's
buried; he cannot come out on 's grave.
DOCTOR  Even so?
LADY MACBETH  To bed, to bed.
There's knocking at the
gate.
Come, come, come, come.
Give me your
hand.
What's done cannot be undone.
To bed, to
bed, to bed.
[Lady Macbeth exits.]
DOCTOR  Will she go now to bed?
GENTLEWOMAN  Directly.
DOCTOR
Foul whisp'rings are abroad.
Unnatural deeds
Do breed unnatural troubles.
Infected minds
To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.
More needs she the divine than the physician.
God, God forgive us all.
Look after her.
Remove from her the means of all annoyance
And still keep eyes upon her.
So, good night.
My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.
I think but dare not speak.
GENTLEWOMAN  Good night, good doctor.
[They exit.]
Scene 2
=======
[Drum and Colors.
Enter Menteith, Caithness, Angus,
Lennox, and Soldiers.]
MENTEITH
The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,
His uncle Siward, and the good Macduff.
Revenges burn in them, for their dear causes
Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
Excite the mortified man.
ANGUS  Near Birnam Wood
Shall we well meet them.
That way are they coming.
CAITHNESS
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?
LENNOX
For certain, sir, he is not.
I have a file
Of all the gentry.
There is Siward's son
And many unrough youths that even now
Protest their first of manhood.
MENTEITH  What does the tyrant?
CAITHNESS
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.
Some say he's mad; others that lesser hate him
Do call it valiant fury.
But for certain
He cannot buckle his distempered cause
Within the belt of rule.
ANGUS  Now does he feel
His secret murders sticking on his hands.
Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach.
Those he commands move only in command,
Nothing in love.
Now does he feel his title
Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe
Upon a dwarfish thief.
MENTEITH  Who, then, shall blame
His pestered senses to recoil and start
When all that is within him does condemn
Itself for being there?
CAITHNESS  Well, march we on
To give obedience where 'tis truly owed.
Meet we the med'cine of the sickly weal,
And with him pour we in our country's purge
Each drop of us.
LENNOX  Or so much as it needs
To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.
Make we our march towards Birnam.
[They exit marching.]
Scene 3
=======
[Enter Macbeth, the Doctor, and Attendants.]
MACBETH
Bring me no more reports.
Let them fly all.
Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane
I cannot taint with fear.
What's the boy Malcolm?
Was he not born of woman?
The spirits that know
All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:
"Fear not, Macbeth.
No man that's born of woman
Shall e'er have power upon thee."
Then fly, false
thanes,
And mingle with the English epicures.
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.
[Enter Servant.]
The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!
Where got'st thou that goose-look?
SERVANT  There is ten thousand--

MACBETH  Geese, villain?
SERVANT  Soldiers, sir.
MACBETH
Go prick thy face and over-red thy fear,
Thou lily-livered boy.
What soldiers, patch?
Death of thy soul!
Those linen cheeks of thine
Are counselors to fear.
What soldiers, whey-face?
SERVANT  The English force, so please you.
MACBETH
Take thy face hence.
[Servant exits.]
Seyton!--I am sick at heart
When I behold--Seyton, I say!--This push
Will cheer me ever or disseat me now.
I have lived long enough.
My way of life
Is fall'n into the sere, the yellow leaf,
And that which should accompany old age,
As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,
I must not look to have, but in their stead
Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honor, breath
Which the poor heart would fain deny and dare
not.--
Seyton!
[Enter Seyton.]
SEYTON
What's your gracious pleasure?
MACBETH  What news more?
SEYTON
All is confirmed, my lord, which was reported.
MACBETH
I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hacked.
Give me my armor.
SEYTON  'Tis not needed yet.
MACBETH  I'll put it on.
Send out more horses.
Skirr the country round.
Hang those that talk of fear.
Give me mine
armor.--
How does your patient, doctor?
DOCTOR  Not so sick, my lord,
As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies
That keep her from her rest.
MACBETH  Cure her of that.
Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
Raze out the written troubles of the brain,
And with some sweet oblivious antidote
Cleanse the stuffed bosom of that perilous stuff
Which weighs upon the heart?
DOCTOR  Therein the patient
Must minister to himself.
MACBETH
Throw physic to the dogs.
I'll none of it.--
Come, put mine armor on.
Give me my staff.
[Attendants begin to arm him.]
Seyton, send out.--Doctor, the thanes fly from
me.--
Come, sir, dispatch.--If thou couldst, doctor, cast
The water of my land, find her disease,
And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
I would applaud thee to the very echo
That should applaud again.--Pull 't off, I say.--
What rhubarb, senna, or what purgative drug
Would scour these English hence?
Hear'st thou of
them?
DOCTOR
Ay, my good lord.
Your royal preparation
Makes us hear something.
MACBETH  Bring it after me.--
I will not be afraid of death and bane
Till Birnam Forest come to Dunsinane.
DOCTOR, [aside]
Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,
Profit again should hardly draw me here.
[They exit.]
Scene 4
=======
[Drum and Colors.
Enter Malcolm, Siward, Macduff,
Siward's son, Menteith, Caithness, Angus, and Soldiers,
marching.]
MALCOLM
Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand
That chambers will be safe.
MENTEITH  We doubt it nothing.
SIWARD
What wood is this before us?
MENTEITH  The Wood of Birnam.
MALCOLM
Let every soldier hew him down a bough
And bear 't before him.
Thereby shall we shadow
The numbers of our host and make discovery
Err in report of us.
SOLDIER  It shall be done.
SIWARD
We learn no other but the confident tyrant
Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure
Our setting down before 't.
MALCOLM  'Tis his main hope;
For, where there is advantage to be given,
Both more and less have given him the revolt,
And none serve with him but constrained things
Whose hearts are absent too.
MACDUFF  Let our just censures
Attend the true event, and put we on
Industrious soldiership.
SIWARD  The time approaches
That will with due decision make us know
What we shall say we have and what we owe.
Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,
But certain issue strokes must arbitrate;
Towards which, advance the war.
[They exit marching.]
Scene 5
=======
[Enter Macbeth, Seyton, and Soldiers, with Drum and
Colors.]
MACBETH
Hang out our banners on the outward walls.
The cry is still "They come!"
Our castle's strength
Will laugh a siege to scorn.
Here let them lie
Till famine and the ague eat them up.
Were they not forced with those that should be
ours,
We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,
And beat them backward home.
[A cry within of women.]
What is that noise?
SEYTON
It is the cry of women, my good lord.
[He exits.]
MACBETH
I have almost forgot the taste of fears.
The time has been my senses would have cooled
To hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hair
Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
As life were in 't.
I have supped full with horrors.
Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,
Cannot once start me.
[Enter Seyton.]
Wherefore was that cry?
SEYTON  The Queen, my lord, is dead.
MACBETH  She should have died hereafter.
There would have been a time for such a word.
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
To the last syllable of recorded time,
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death.
Out, out, brief candle!
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
And then is heard no more.
It is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.
[Enter a Messenger.]
Thou com'st to use thy tongue: thy story quickly.
MESSENGER  Gracious my lord,
I should report that which I say I saw,
But know not how to do 't.
MACBETH  Well, say, sir.
MESSENGER
As I did stand my watch upon the hill,
I looked toward Birnam, and anon methought
The Wood began to move.
MACBETH  Liar and slave!
MESSENGER
Let me endure your wrath if 't be not so.
Within this three mile may you see it coming.
I say, a moving grove.
MACBETH  If thou speak'st false,
Upon the next tree shall thou hang alive
Till famine cling thee.
If thy speech be sooth,
I care not if thou dost for me as much.--
I pull in resolution and begin
To doubt th' equivocation of the fiend,
That lies like truth.
"Fear not till Birnam Wood
Do come to Dunsinane," and now a wood
Comes toward Dunsinane.--Arm, arm, and out!--
If this which he avouches does appear,
There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.
I 'gin to be aweary of the sun
And wish th' estate o' th' world were now
undone.--
Ring the alarum bell!--Blow wind, come wrack,
At least we'll die with harness on our back.
[They exit.]
Scene 6
=======
[Drum and Colors.
Enter Malcolm, Siward, Macduff, and
their army, with boughs.]
MALCOLM
Now near enough.
Your leafy screens throw down
And show like those you are.--You, worthy uncle,
Shall with my cousin, your right noble son,
Lead our first battle.
Worthy Macduff and we
Shall take upon 's what else remains to do,
According to our order.
SIWARD  Fare you well.
Do we but find the tyrant's power tonight,
Let us be beaten if we cannot fight.
MACDUFF
Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,
Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.
[They exit.]
[Alarums continued.]
Scene 7
=======
[Enter Macbeth.]
MACBETH
They have tied me to a stake.
I cannot fly,
But, bear-like, I must fight the course.
What's he
That was not born of woman?
Such a one
Am I to fear, or none.
[Enter young Siward.]
YOUNG SIWARD  What is thy name?
MACBETH  Thou 'lt be afraid to hear it.
YOUNG SIWARD
No, though thou call'st thyself a hotter name
Than any is in hell.
MACBETH  My name's Macbeth.
YOUNG SIWARD
The devil himself could not pronounce a title
More hateful to mine ear.
MACBETH  No, nor more fearful.
YOUNG SIWARD
Thou liest, abhorred tyrant.
With my sword
I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.
[They fight, and young Siward is slain.]
MACBETH  Thou wast born of
woman.
But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,
Brandished by man that's of a woman born.
[He exits.]
[Alarums.
Enter Macduff.]
MACDUFF
That way the noise is.
Tyrant, show thy face!
If thou beest slain, and with no stroke of mine,
My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.
I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
Are hired to bear their staves.
Either thou, Macbeth,
Or else my sword with an unbattered edge
I sheathe again undeeded.
There thou shouldst be;
By this great clatter, one of greatest note
Seems bruited.
Let me find him, Fortune,
And more I beg not.
[He exits.
Alarums.]
[Enter Malcolm and Siward.]
SIWARD
This way, my lord.
The castle's gently rendered.
The tyrant's people on both sides do fight,
The noble thanes do bravely in the war,
The day almost itself professes yours,
And little is to do.
MALCOLM  We have met with foes
That strike beside us.
SIWARD  Enter, sir, the castle.
[They exit.
Alarum.]
Scene 8
=======
[Enter Macbeth.]
MACBETH
Why should I play the Roman fool and die
On mine own sword?
Whiles I see lives, the gashes
Do better upon them.
[Enter Macduff.]
MACDUFF  Turn, hellhound, turn!
MACBETH
Of all men else I have avoided thee.
But get thee back.
My soul is too much charged
With blood of thine already.
MACDUFF  I have no words;
My voice is in my sword, thou bloodier villain
Than terms can give thee out.
[Fight.
Alarum.]
MACBETH  Thou losest labor.
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed.
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
I bear a charmed life, which must not yield
To one of woman born.
MACDUFF  Despair thy charm,
And let the angel whom thou still hast served
Tell thee Macduff was from his mother's womb
Untimely ripped.
MACBETH
Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,
For it hath cowed my better part of man!
And be these juggling fiends no more believed
That palter with us in a double sense,
That keep the word of promise to our ear
And break it to our hope.
I'll not fight with thee.
MACDUFF  Then yield thee, coward,
And live to be the show and gaze o' th' time.
We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,
Painted upon a pole, and underwrit
"Here may you see the tyrant."
MACBETH  I will not yield
To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet
And to be baited with the rabble's curse.
Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane
And thou opposed, being of no woman born,
Yet I will try the last.
Before my body
I throw my warlike shield.
Lay on, Macduff,
And damned be him that first cries "Hold!
Enough!"
[They exit fighting.
Alarums.]
[They enter fighting, and Macbeth is slain.
Macduff
exits carrying off Macbeth's body.
Retreat and flourish.
Enter, with Drum and Colors, Malcolm, Siward, Ross,
Thanes, and Soldiers.]
MALCOLM
I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.
SIWARD
Some must go off; and yet by these I see
So great a day as this is cheaply bought.
MALCOLM
Macduff is missing, and your noble son.
ROSS
Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt.
He only lived but till he was a man,
The which no sooner had his prowess confirmed
In the unshrinking station where he fought,
But like a man he died.
SIWARD  Then he is dead?
ROSS
Ay, and brought off the field.
Your cause of sorrow
Must not be measured by his worth, for then
It hath no end.
SIWARD  Had he his hurts before?
ROSS
Ay, on the front.
SIWARD  Why then, God's soldier be he!
Had I as many sons as I have hairs,
I would not wish them to a fairer death;
And so his knell is knolled.
MALCOLM
He's worth more sorrow, and that I'll spend for
him.
SIWARD  He's worth no more.
They say he parted well and paid his score,
And so, God be with him.
Here comes newer
comfort.
[Enter Macduff with Macbeth's head.]
MACDUFF
Hail, King!
for so thou art.
Behold where stands
Th' usurper's cursed head.
The time is free.
I see thee compassed with thy kingdom's pearl,
That speak my salutation in their minds,
Whose voices I desire aloud with mine.
Hail, King of Scotland!
ALL  Hail, King of Scotland!
[Flourish.]
MALCOLM
We shall not spend a large expense of time
Before we reckon with your several loves
And make us even with you.
My thanes and
kinsmen,
Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland
In such an honor named.
What's more to do,
Which would be planted newly with the time,
As calling home our exiled friends abroad
That fled the snares of watchful tyranny,
Producing forth the cruel ministers
Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen
(Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands,
Took off her life)--this, and what needful else
That calls upon us, by the grace of grace,
We will perform in measure, time, and place.
So thanks to all at once and to each one,
Whom we invite to see us crowned at Scone.
[Flourish.
All exit.]
After the waste of many thousand wounds
Given and received alike, in seven set battles,
Lydia’s old King (upon conditions signed
For peace and truce), entered constrainèd league
With his fierce enemy the Lycian King,
Gave him in hostage as his pledge of faith
His nephew, Lord Lapyrus, and received
Noble Zantippus from the Lycian,
To make the contract full and honourable.
This Lord Lapyrus entertained and welcomed By [ ],
But chiefly by the fair Eurymone,
The King’s sole daughter, who unto Lapyrus
Offers her as his bride, so he would turn
A traitor to his country and his king.
Lapyrus, to obtain the beauteous maid,
Turns traitor to his king, and joins his force
Unto his fair love’s father’s, Lycia’s king’s;
Th’old King of Lydia, being so beset
By his own nephew’s unexpected treacheries,
Sent forth his son Tymethes to crave aid
From Armatrites, King of great Cilicia,
Which he obtained—in a disastrous hour,
As the event will witness.
In this trouble
The frighted Queen with her two infants fled
Into a forest, fearing the sad ruin
Hourly expected, until Armatrites
With a fresh army forced Lapyrus fly
And saved the King, doomed for worse treachery.
What follows shows itself; ’tis our full due,
If we with labour give content to you.
Speranza
Long live Armatrites, King of Lydia!
How?
Art thou amazed, old King, and all thy people
Mutually labouring in a fit of wonder?
Start from those pale dreams: we will prove all true.
Who wins the day, the brightness is his due.
King of Cilicia—
Ay, and Lydia now.
Bate us not our titles: we and ours
Have sweat and dearly earned them in our flesh.
It savours not of nobleness nor virtue,
Religion, loyalty, heaven or nature’s laws
So most perfidiously to enter, tyrant,
Where was expected honesty and honour,
Assistance from a friend, not a dissembler,
A royal neighbour and no politic foe.
What worse than this could th’enemy perform?
And when shines friendship best but in a storm?
Why, doting Lydia, is it of no virtue
To bring our army hither, and put in venture
Our person and their lives upon your foes?
Wasting our courage, weak’ning our best forces,
Impoverishing the heart of our munition,
And having won the honour of the battle
To throw our glory on unworthy spirits,
And so unload victory’s honey thighs
To let drones feed?
Will nothing satisfy but all?
Without all, nothing.
The kingdom, and not under, suits our blood.
Flies are not eagles’ preys, nor thanks our food.
And for Cilicia, our other sphere—
Our son Zenarchus, let thy beams move there.
Rather, my lord, let me move pity here
Unto that reverend fate-afflicted king—
For whom, with his disconsolate son (my friend
And plighted brother) I here kneel as suitor.
O my most noble father, still retain
The seal of honour and religïon.
A kingdom rightfully possessed by course
Contains more joy than is usurped by force.
The boy hath almost changed us.
He cools.—My lord, remember: you are possessed.
What, with the devil?
The devil!
The dukedom, the kingdom, Lydia.
All pant under your sceptre; the sway’s yours.
Be not bought out with words.
A kingdom’s dear.
Kiss fortune, keep your mind, and keep your state.
You’re laughed at if you prove compassionate.
Thanks to Mazeres; he hath refreshed our spirits.—
Zenarchus, ’tis thy death if thou proceed.
Thy words we threat; rise silent, or else bleed.
Who can expect but blood where tyrants govern?
We are not yet so cruel to thy fortune
As was Lapyrus, thy own nephew, treacherous—
That stole upon thy life, beseiged thee basely,
And had betrayed thee to thine enemies’ anger
Had we not beat his strength to his own throat
And made him shrink before us.
All can tell
In him ’twas monstrous; ’tis in us but .
. . well,
A trick of war, advantage, policy—
Nay, rather recompense.
There’s more deceit in peace: ’tis common there
T’unfold young heirs; the old may well stand bare.
You have your life, be thankful—and ’tis more
Than your perfidious nephew would consent to,
Had he surprised you first.
Your fate is cast.
The sooner you be gone, ’twill prove the safer.
On thee, Lapyrus, and thy treacheries, fall
The heavy burden of an old man’s curse.
Your Queen with her two infants fled the city,
Affrighted at this treason and new wars.
News of more sadness than the kingdom’s loss!
She fled upon her hour, for had she stayed
She’d either died, been banished or betrayed.—
I have some servants here.
All these, my lord.
All these?
Not all.
You did forget:
I am not worth the flattering.
I am done,
Old and at set; honour the rising sun.
If any for love serve me, which is he?
Now let him shame the world and follow me.
That’s I, my lord.
And I.
What, two of you?—
Let it be enrolled
Two follow a king when he is poor and old.
Farewell, king.
I’ll play the flounder: keep me to my tide.
And so will I: this is the flowing side.
Those men are yours, my lord.
We’ll grace them chiefly.—
Wait for employment, place and eminence; 
The like to each that to our bounty flies,
For he that falls to us shall surely rise.—
His son Tymethes little frights our thoughts:
He’s young, and given to pleasure, not to plots.
Your grace defines him right.
He may remain; 
The Prince, your son, binds him in a love-chain.
There’s little fear of him.
Their loves are dear.
Base boy, he leaves his father to live here.
His presence sets a gloss on your attempts;
They have their lustre from him.
He’s their countenance.
’Twas well observed and followed; he shall stay.
Mazeres, thou armest us that won the day.
None but Mazeres, that court fly, could on
The virtues of the King blow such corruption.
Man falls to vice in minutes, runs and leaps,
But unto goodness he takes wary steps.
How soon a tyrant—
Why, Tymethes!
friend, brother!
Peace, prithee, peace.
You undo me if you wake me;
I hope I’m in a dream.
Would ’twere so happy!
No?
Why then, wake, beggar!
But the comfort is
I have brave seeming-kinsmen.
Why, Zenarchus,
’Tis not the loss of kingdom, father’s banishment,
Uncertainty of mother, afflicts me
With half the violence that those crossed affections
Betwixt your princely sister and ourself,
Who, upon fortune or her father’s frown
Erecting the whole fabric of her love,
Either now will not, or else dare not, love me.
Chance alters not affection: see in me
That hold thee dear still spite of tyranny.
Fate does but dim the gloss of a right man;
He still retains his worth, do what fate can.
Change faith for dross?
I will not call her sister,
That shall hate virtue for afflictïon.
And here she comes to clear those doubts herself.
Strange alteration!
Will the King my father
Go to his grave a ruffian and a treacher?
In his grey hairs turn tyrant to his friends?
Wasting his penitential times in plots,
Acting more sins than he hath tears to weep them?
Alas, lady, fortune hath changed my state.
Can you love a beggar?
Why, fortune hath the least command o’er love.
She cannot drive Tymethes from himself,
And ’tis Tymethes, not his painted glories,
My soul in her accomplished wish desires.
What say you now, sir?
Nothing but admire
That heaven can frame a creature like a woman
And she be constant, seeing most are common.
Put by your wonder, sir; she proves the same.
I spoke her virtues for her ere she came,
And when my father dies I here do vow,
This kingdom now detainèd wrongfully
Shall then return unforcèdly to you,
In part thy dowry, but in all thy due.
Unmatchèd honest young man!
Come, let your lips meet, though your fortunes wander.
Ha!
Taste lips so bounteously with a beggar?
Thus in firm state let your affections rest.
Time, that makes wretched, makes the same men blest.
What’s here?
Either the princes (out of charity’s rareness)
Are pleased to lay aside their glories, and 
refresh The gasping fortunes of a desperate wretch;
Or if for larger bounties [...]; I was mad
T’advise the King for his remaining here
That had been banished, and with him my fear.
I love the princess, and the King allows it.
If he should prove a rival to my love,
I have argued fair for his abiding here.
My plots shall work his ruin; if one fail
I’ll raise a second, for I must prevail.
I that used policy to cause him stay
Can show like art to rid my fears away.
O whither shall I fly with these poor babes?
Twice set upon by thieves within this forest,
Who robbed me of my clothes, and left me these,
Which better suit with my calamity.
What fate pursues the good old King my husband,
I cannot learn, which is my worst affliction.
O treacherous Lapyrus!
Impious nephew!
All horrors of a guilty breast keep with thee!—
Either, poor babes, you must pine here for food,
Or have the wars drink your immaculate blood.
O fly, lest life and honour be betrayed.
Villain and fugitive, where wilt thou hide
Th’abhorrèd burden of thy wretched flesh?
In what disguise canst thou be safe and free,
Having betrayed thy country?
Base Lapyrus!
Earth, stretch thy throat: take down this bitter pill,
Loathing the hateful taste of his own ill.
O help!
Good heaven, save a poor wretch from slaughter!
Stop her mouth first.
Soldiers must have their sport.
’Tis dearly earned; they venture their blood for’t.
A mother so enforced by pitiless slaves?
Let me redeem my honour in her rescue,
And in this deed my former baseness die.
Come, come.
If ever woman bore you—
Whoe’er bore them,
Monsters begot them.
Merciless damned villains!
Hold, hold, sir; we are soldiers, but do not love to fight.
Let me dissuade you from all hope of recompense
Save thanks and prayers, which are the beggar’s gifts.
You cannot give me that I have more need of
Than prayers, for my soul hath a poor stock.
There’s a fair house within, but ’tis ill furnished:
There wants true tears for hangings, penitent falls—
For without prayers, soldiers are but bare walls.
Whence are you?
that with such a careful charge
Dare pass this dangerous forest?
Generous sir,
I was of Lydia once, as happy then
As now unfortunate, till one Lapyrus,
That traiterous villain, nephew to the King,
Sought the confusion of his state and him,
And with a secret army girt his land
When peace was plighted by his enemy’s hand,
Little expecting such unnatural treason
From forth a kinsman’s bosom; all admired
But I his miserable queen.
O sink into perdition!
Let me hear no further.
I’ll tell you all—for your so late attempt
Confirms you honest, and my thoughts so keep you.
I, frighted at new wars and his false breath,
Chose rather with these babes this lingering death.
O, in her words I endure a thousand deaths!
The truth of this sad story hath been yours;
Now, courteous sir, may I request your name?
That in my prayers I may place the same.
I’ll put my death into her woeful hands.
I hear you not, sir.
I desire your name.
To add some small content to your distress,
Know that Lapyrus, whom your miseries
May rightly curse and be revengèd justly,
Lurks in this forest equally distressed.
Lurks in this forest that abhorrèd villain?
These eyes did see him—and faith, lady, say
If you should meet that worst of villains here,
That treacher, monster, what would you attempt?
His speedy death.
I should forget all mercy,
Had I but means fully to express my vengeance.
You would not, Queen.
No?
By these infants’ tears
That weep for hunger, I would throughly do’t.
See, yonder he comes.
O where?
Here, take my sword.
Are you yet constant?
Shame your sex, and be so.
Will you do’t?
I see him not.
Strike him through his guilt and treachery
And let him see the horrors of his perjured soul.
Are you ready?
Pray let me see him first.
You see him now—now do’t!
Lapyrus!
O fortunate revenge!
Now all thy villanies
Shall be at once requited: thy country’s ruin,
The King thy uncle’s sorrow, my own miseries,
Shall at this minute all one vengeance meet.—
Alas, he doth submit, prays, and relents.
Who could wish more?
None made from woman can.
Small glory ’twere to kill a kneeling man.
When he in penitent sighs his soul commends
Thou send’st him to the gods, thyself to th’ fiends.—
But hearken to thy piteous infants’ cries,
And they’re for vengeance.
Peace then: now he dies.
—Ungrateful woman, he delivered thee
From ravishment; canst thou his murd’ress be?
What’s riches to thy honour?
That rare treasure
Which worlds redeem not, yet ’tis lost at pleasure.
Kill him that preserved that?
and in thy rescue
His noble rage so manfully behaved?—
Rise, rise!
He that repents is ever saved.
Will misery yet a longer life afford,
To see a queen so poor, not worth her word?
I am better than my word; my word was death.
Man’s ne’er past grief, till he be past his breath.
I pardon all, Lapyrus.
Do not do’t.
And only to one penance I enjoin thee
For all thy faults past: while we here remain
Within this forest, this thy task shall be—
To procure succour to my babes and me.
And if I fail, may the earth swallow me.
Thou’rt now grown good.
Here could I ever dwell,
Were the old King, my husband, safe and well.
Come, come, drive away these fits.
Faith, I’ll have
thee merry.
As your son and heir at his father’s funeral.
Thou seest my sister constantly affects thee.
There were no mirth nor music else for me.
Sir, in this castle the old King my father,
O’erworn with jealousy, keeps his beauteous wife;
I think thou never saw’st her.
No, not I.
Why then, thy judgement’s fresh.
I’ll visit her
O’ purpose for thy censure.
I speak my affection.
Nay on my knowledge she’s worth jealousy,
Though jealousy be far unworth a king.
My loved lord?
How cheers the Queen?
Have I not seen this fellow before now?
He has an excellent presence for a pander;
I know not his office.
Use those words to her.
They shall be used, my lord—and any thing
That comes to using, let it come to me.
Exit
What’s he, Zenarchus?
Who, Roxano?
A fellow in great trust,
Elected by my father’s jealousy.
But he and all the rest attend upon her
I think would turn her panders for reward—
For ’tis not watch nor ward keeps woman chaste,
If honour’s watch in her mind be not placed.
Right oracle!
What gain hath jealousy?
Fruitless suspicion, sighs, ridiculous groans.
Hunger and lust will break through flesh and stones,
And like a whirlwind blows ope castle doors,
Italian padlocks, [ ].
What mad lords are your jealous people then,
That lock their wives from all men but their men?
Make ’em their keepers, to prevent some greater.
So oft it happens to the poor’s relief:
Keepers eat venison, when their lords eat beef.
See, see, she comes.
Honour of beauty!
There man’s wishes rise.
Grace and perfection lighten from her eyes;
Amazement is shot through me.
’Tis Tymethes, lady,
Son to the banished King.
Is this he?
It is, sweet lady.
I never knew the force of a desire
Until this minute struck within my blood.
I fear one look was destined to undo me.
Why, Tymethes!
Friend?
Ha?
A courtier,
And forget your first weapon?
Go and salute
Our lady mother.
He makes towards us.—
You’re Prince Tymethes?
So I understand.
The same unfortunate, most gracious lady,
Supremest of your sex in all perfections.
Sir, you’re forgetful.
This is no place for courtship,
Nor we a subject for’t.
Return to your friend.
All hopes killed in their blossom.
Too cruelly, in faith, I put him by.—
Wine for our son Zenarchus!
’Twas done kindly.
You, son, and our best visitant—
Duty binds me.
Begin to me, Zenarchus; I’ll have’t so.
Why then there’s hope she’ll take occasïon
To drink to me; she hath no means t’avoid it.
I’ll prevent all loose thoughts, drink to myself.
My mind walks yonder, but suspèct walks here.
The devil’s on that side and engrosses all,
Smiles, favours, common courtesies—none can fall
But he has a snatch at ’em.
Not drink to me?
Make you yon stranger drink.
Pox on’t, not I.
I speak strange words against my fantasy.
Prithee, Tymethes, drink!
I am not dry.
I think so too; dry, and so young?
’Twere strange.
Come prithee, drink to the Queen, my mother.
You shall rule me.—Unto that beauteous majesty!
Thanks, noble sir.
I must be wary; my mind’s dangerous.—
I’ll pledge you anon, sir.
Heart!
How contempt ill fortune does pursue!
Not drink, nor pledge: what was she born to do?
I’ll stay no longer, lest I get that flame
Which nothing but cold death can quench or tame.—
Zenarchus, come.
I go.—
Music of mind to the Queen.
To you no less.
And all that you can wish, or I express.
Thanks to our son!—
Th’other took leave in silence, but left me
To speak enough both for myself and he.
Tymethes?
That’s his name.
Poor heart, take heed:
Look well into th’event ere thou proceed.
Love, yet be wise; impossible, none can.
If e’er the wise man claim one foolish hour,
’Tis when he loves; he’s then in folly’s power.
I need not fear the servants that o’erwatch me;
Their faiths lie in my coffers, in effect,
More true to me than to my lord’s suspèct.
The fears and dangers that most threaten me
Live in the party that I must enjoy,
And that’s Tymethes.
Men are apt to boast.
He may in full cups blaze and vaunt himself
Unto some meaner mistress, make my shame
The politic engine to beat down her name,
And from thence force a way to the King’s ears.
Strange fate: where my love keeps, there keep my fears.
Alone?
Why, where’s her guard?
Suffer her alone?
Her thoughts may work; their powers are not her own.
Women have of themselves no entire sway;
Like dial needles they wave every way,
And must be throughly taught to be kept right
And point to none but to their lord’s delight.
Time to convey and plot?
Leave her alone!—
Why, villains!
Kiss me, my perfectïon.
This night we’ll banquet in these blissful arms.
Your nights are music, and your words are charms.
Kiss me again, fair Thetis.
My lady is scarce perfect in her thoughts,
Howe’er she framed a smile upon the tyrant.
I have some skill in faces—and yet they never were
more deceitful.
A man can scarce know a bawd from
a midwife by the face, an hypocritical puritan from
a devout Christian, if you go by the face.
Well, all’s
not straight in my lady.
She hath certain crooked
cogitations, if a man had the liberty to search ’em.
If aught point at my advice or performance, she may
fortunately disclose it: she knows my mettle, and what
it yields to an ounce.
She cannot be deceived in’t:
here’s service, and secrecy, and no lady can wish more,
beside a monkey.
She is assured of our faculties; there’s
none of us all that stand her smock-sentinels but would
venture a joint to do her any pleasurable service, and
I think that’s as much as any woman desires.—Mass,
here she comes.
’Tis some strange physic; I know by the working.
It cannot be kept down with any argument.
’Tis of aspiring force; sparks fly not downward,
No more this rèceived fancy of Tymethes.
I threaten it with my lord’s jealousy,
Yet still it rises against all objections.
I see my dangers, in what fears I dwell;
There’s but a plank on which I run to hell,
Yet were’t thrice narrower I should venture on.
None dares do more for sin than woman can.
Misery of love—Roxano?
I am observed.—
What news, Roxano?
None that’s good, madam.
No?
Which is the bad?
The worst of all is, madam, you are sad.
Indeed I am not merry.
Would I knew the means would make you so!
I would turn myself into any shape or office
To be the author on’t, sweet lady.
Troth, I have that hope of thee, I think thou wouldst.
Think it?
’Sfoot, you might swear safely in that action
And never hurt your oath.
I ne’er failed yet.
’Twere sin to injure thee; I know thou didst not.
Nay, I know I did not.
But, my trusty servant,
This plot requires art, secrecy and wit,
Yet out of all can hardly work one safety.
Not one?
That’s strange.
I would ’twere put to me.
I’ll make it arrive safe whate’er it be.
Thou couldst not, my Roxano.
Why, admit I love,
Now I come to thee.
Admit you love?
Why, all’s safe enough yet.
Ay, but a stranger?
Nay, now we are all spoiled, lady.
I may look for
my brains in my boots—now you have put home to me
indeed, madam.
A stranger?
There’s a hundred deaths
i’th’ very name, besides vantage.
I said I should affright thee.
Faith, no fool can fright me, madam, commonly
called a stranger.
Hast thou the will?
Or dar’st thou do me good?
Do thee good, sweet lady?
As far as I am able,
ne’er doubt it.
Let me but cast about for safety, and I’ll
do anything, madam.
Ay, ay, our safeties, which are mere impossibles.
Love forgets all things but its proper objects.
What is he?
And his name?
Tymethes, in a most unlucky minute
Led hither by our son-in-law Zenarchus.
Hmm.
. . is that the most fortunate, spidercatching,
smock-wrapped gentleman?
Yet if he know me—
What then?
I am undone.
And is it possible a man should lie with a woman,
and yet not know her?
And yet ’tis possible too—
Thank my invention, follow that game still.
He must not know me.
Then I love no further,
Although for not enjoying him I die.
My lord’s pale jealousy does so o’erlook me
That if Tymethes know what he enjoys
It may make way unto my lord’s mistrust;
Then, since in my desire such horrors move,
I’ll die no other than the death of love.
Lady!
Madam, do you hear?
Have you leisure to
swoon now, when I have taken such pains i’th’ business
to take order for your safety, set all things right?
Why, Madam!
What says the man?
Why, he says like a gentleman, every inch of
him, and will perform the office of a gentleman: bring
you together, put you together, and leave you together.
What gentleman can do more?
And all this safely?
And all this safely.
Ay, by this hand will I, or
else would I might never do anything to purpose.
If he have but the first part of a young gentleman in him, ’tis
granted, madam.
I have crotchets in my brain that you
shall see him and enjoy him, and he not know where
he is, nor who it is.
How?
Shall he not know me?
Why ’tis the least part of my meaning he should,
lady.
Do you think you could possibly be safe, an he
know you?
Why, some of your young gallants are of
that vainglorious and preposterous humour that if they
lay with their own sisters you should hear ’em prate 
on’t!
This is too usual.
There’s no wonder in’t.
What I
have said, I will swear to perform: you shall enjoy him
ere night, and he not know you next morning.
Thou art not only necessary but pleasing,
There, catch our bounty.
Manage all but right,
As now with gold, with honours we’ll requite.
I am your creature, lady.
Pretty gold, And by this light methinks most easily earned.
There’s no faculty, say I, like a pander, and that makes
so many nowadays die i’th’ trade.
I have your gold,
lady, And eke your service.
I am one step higher;
This office makes a gentleman a squire.
Come, fellow Corydon, are the pits digged?
Ay, and as deep as an usurer’s conscience, I
warrant thee.
Mass, and that’s deep enough; 
’twill devour a widow and three orphans at a breakfast.
Soft,
is this it?
Ay, ay, this is it.
Nay, for the deepness I’ll be sworn.
But come,
my masters, and lay these boughs crossover, so, so,
artificially, and may all those whoreson muttonmongers
the wolves hole here, which eat our sheep.
I wonder what wolves those are which
eat our sheep, whether they be he-wolves or shewolves?
They should be he-wolves by their loving mutton,
But by their greediness they should be she-wolves,
For the belly of a she-wolf
Is never satisfied till it be dammed up.
Why are the she-wolves worse than the he’s?
Why, is not the dam worse than the devil, pray?
You have answered me there indeed.
Why, man, if all the earth were parchment, the
sea ink, every stick a pen, and every knave a scrivener,
they were not all able to write down the knaveries of she-wolves.
A murrain on them, he’s or she’s!
They
suck the blood of none but our lambs.
O always the weakest goes to the wall—as for
example, knock down a sheep and he tumbles forwards,
knock down a woman and she tumbles backwards.
Sirrah, I wonder how many sorts of wolves there be?
Marry, just as many sorts as there be knaves in the cards.
Why, that’s four.
First, there are your court-wolves, and those be
foul eaters and clean drinkers.
And why ‘clean drinkers’?
Why, because when they be drunk they commonly
cast up all, and so make cleansing work on’t.
So sir, those are clean drinkers, indeed.
The next are your country-wolves: nothing chokes
them but plenty.
They sing like sirens when corn goes
out by shipfulls, and dance after no tune but after ‘an
angel a bushel’.
The halter take such corn-cutters!
Are there no city-wolves?
A rope on them!
Yes, huge routs, you shall have
Long Lane full of them.
They’ll feed upon any whore,
carrion, thief, or anything.
Have they such maws?
Maws?
Why, man, fiddlers have no better guts.
I have known some of them eat up a lord at three bites.
Three bonds, you mean.
A knight is nobody with them; a young gentleman 
is swallowed whole, like a gudgeon.
I wonder that gudgeon does not choke him.
A gudgeon choke him?
If the throat of his conscience
be sound, he’ll gulp down anything.
Five of 
your silken gallants are swallowed easier than a damask
prune—for our city-wolves do so roll my young prodigal
first in wax (which is soft), till he look like a gilded pill,
and then so finely wrap him up in satin (which is sleek),
that he goes down without chewing, and thereupon 
they are called slippery gallants.
I’ll be no gentleman for that trick.
The last is your sea-wolf, a horrible ravener too:
he has a belly as big as a ship, and devours as much
silk at a gulp as would serve forty dozen tailors against
a Christmas Day or a running at tilt.
Well, well, now our trap is set what shall
we do with the wolves we catch?
Why, those that are great ones and more than
our matches we’ll let go, and the lesser wolves we will 
hang: shall it be so?
Ay, ay, each man to his stand.
Foul monster-monger, who must live by that
Which is thy own destruction: why should men
Be nature’s bond-slaves?
Every creature else
Comes freely to the table of the earth;
That which for man alone doth all things bear
Scarce gives him his true diet anywhere.
What spiteful winds breathe here, that not a tree
Spreads forth a friendly arm?
Distressèd Queen,
And most accursèd babes!
The earth that bears you
Like a proud mother scorns to give you food.
Ha!
Thanks, fate!
I now defy thee, starveling hunger.
Blessed tree, four lives grow in thy fruit.
Run, taste it then:
Wise men serve first themselves, then other men.
O me accursèd and most miserable!
Help, help!
Some angel lay a list’ning ear
To draw my cry up!—None to lend help?
O,
Then pine and die.
A wolf caught, a wolf caught!
O help!
I am no wolf, good friend.
No?
What art thou then?
A miserable wretch.
An usurer?
No, no.
A broker then?
Mock not a man in woe: in a green wound
Pour balsam, and not physic.
’Snails, he talks like a surgeon.—If you be one,
why do you not help yourself, sir?
I am no surgeon, friend; my name’s Lapyrus.
How?
A wolf caught, ho!—Lap what Lap ho!
Lapyrus is my name; dost thou not know me?
Yes, for a wolfish rascal that would have worried
his own country.
Torture me not, I prithee.
I am that wretch;
A villain I was once, but I am now—
The devil in the vault!
You, sirrah, that betrayed
your country and the old King your uncle, there lie till
one wolf devour another, thou treacherous rascal.
O me!
most miserable and wretched creature!
I now do find there’s a revenging fate
That dooms bad men to be unfortunate.
We are observed.
By whom?
Mazeres follows us.
O, he’s my protested servant, your sole rival.
The devil he is!
You’ll make a hot suitor of him anon.
He may be hot in th’end; his good parts sue for’t.
He eyes us still.
He does.
You shall depart, lady.
I’ll take my leave o’ purpose in his presence.
He’s jealous, and a kiss runs through his heart:
I’ll make a thrust at him upon your lip.
Death!
Minute favours?
Every step a kiss?
I think they count how the day goes by kissing;
’Tis past four since I met ’em.
I’ve hit him in the gall; instead of blood,
He sheds distractions, which are worse than wounds.
But sirrah!
Stays he to prove my rival?
Cursed be th’hour
Wherein I advised the King for his stay here!
I have set slaves t’entrap him, yet none prosper.
I’ll lay no more my faith upon their works.
They’re weak and loose and like a rotten wall;
Leaning on them may hazard my own fall.
I’ll use a swifter course, cut off long journeys
And tedious ways that run my hopes past breath:
I’ll take the plain roadway and hunt his death.
So, so, he departs with a knit brow!
No matter.
When his frown begets earthquakes, haply then
’Twill shake me too.
I shall stand firm till then.
Mass, here a walks.
I am far enough from myself.
I challenge all disguises except drinking
To hide me better; I give way to that—
for that indeed will thrust a white gentleman into a suit
of mud.
But whist, I begin to be noted.
Ay, he changed upon’t.
I marked him.
Good your honours,
your most comfortable charitable relief and devotion to
a poor star-crossed gentleman.
Pox on thee!
I’m bare enough already, if it like your honour.
He did?
‘Pox on thee’?
Your young gallants love to
give no alms, but that that will stick by a man; that’s
one virtue in ’em.
He’s not content to have my hat off,
but he would have my hair off too.
[To Tymethes] Thank
your good lordship!
No!
Was that his action?
It called him lord.
Nay, he’s a villain.
Good your honours!
I have been a man
in my time—
Why, what art thou now?
—kept goodly beasts, had three wives, two men
uprising, three maids down lying.
O good your kind honours!
’Sfoot, I am a beggar myself.
Perhaps your lordship gets by it.
Good your sweet honour!
This fellow would be whipped.
Your Lordship has forgot since you were a beggar.
I’ll give thee somewhat for that jest in truth.
But now you are in private, shut your purse, and open your ear, sir.
How?
He’s dealing his devotion; hinder him not.
I am not literally a beggar, as puritanical as I appear.
The naked truth is you are happily desired—
Ha?
—of the most sweet, delicate, divine, pleasing,
ravishing creature—
Peace, peace, prithee peace!
—that ever made man’s wishes perfect.
Nay, say not so.
I saw one creature lately
Exceeds all human form for true perfection:
This may be beauteous—
This for white and red, sir!
Her honour and my oath sue for that pardon:
You must not know her name, nor see her face.
How?
She rather chooseth death in her neglect
Than so to hazard life or lose respect.
How shall I come at her?
Let your will
Subscribe to the sure means already wrought,
She shall be safely pleased, you safely brought.
Ha!
And is this sheer faith, without any trick in’t?
Let me perish in this office else; and I need wish
No more damnation than to die a pander.
Thou speakest well.
When meet we?
Five is the fixèd hour, upon tomorrow’s evening.
So, the place?
Near to the further lodge.
Go to then!
It holds honest all the way?
Else does there live no honesty but in lawyers.
Enough.
Five?
And the furthest lodge?
I’ll meet thee.
Enjoy the sweetest treasure in a woman.
Always excepting but the tyrant’s gem.
What, have you done with the beggar?
None that lives can say he has done with the beggar.
Hold conference so long with such a fellow?
How?
Are your wits perfect?
If one should refuse
To talk with every beggar, he might refuse
Brave company sometimes—gallants, i’faith.
The loss of my dear Queen afflicts me more
Than all Lapyrus’ cursèd treacheries:
Inhuman monster!
If you have human forms to fit those voices
And hearts that may be pierced with misery’s groans
Sent from a fainting spirit, pity a wretch,
A miserable man, prisoner to darkness!
Your charitable strengths this way repair,
And lift my flesh to the reviving air.
Alas, some travelling man, by night outstripped,
Missing his way, into this danger slipped.
Set all our hands to help him.—Come, good man,
They that sit high may make their ends below.
Millions of thanks and praises!
You’re heavy, sir, whoe’er you be.
There’s weight within keeps down my soul and me.
One full strength more Makes our pains happy;
poor strength helps the poor.
So sir, you’re welcome to—Lapyrus?
O!
We do forgive thy treachery: revive.
’Tis pity, and not hate, makes goodness thrive.
O that astonishment had left me dead!
Shame, sitting on my brow, weighs down my head.
Even thus the guilt of my abhorrèd sin
Flashed in my face when I beheld the Queen.
Our Queen!
O, where, Lapyrus?
Tell the rest.
Within this forest with her babes distressed.
Which way?
Lead, dear Lapyrus.
Follow me then.
Not only shall we quit thy soul’s offence
But give thy happy labour recompense.
The miserable Queen expecting still
The infants’ succour from Lapyrus’ hand
(Who wants himself), it chanced through èxtreme want
The youngest died, and this so near his end
That had not shepherds happily passed by
And on the babe cast a compassionate eye
And snatched the child out of the arms of death
(Where the sad mother left it), the same hour
Had been his grave that gives his life new power.
Thus the distressèd Queen, to them unknown,
Was as a nurse received unto her own—
Whose sight Lapyrus missing, having led
The King her husband to this hapless place,
They all depart in èxtreme height of grief
To get unto their own sad wants relief.
This is the farther lodge, the place of meeting;
The hour scarce come yet.
Well, I was not born to this.
There’s not a hair to choose betwixt me and a pander
in this case, shift it off as well as I can.
I do envy
this fellow’s happiness now, and could cut his throat at
pleasure.
I could e’en gnaw feathers now to think of his
downy felicity.
I that could never aspire above a dairy
wench, the very cream of my fortunes—that he should
bathe in nectar, and I most unfortunate in buttermilk,
this is good dealing now, is’t?
I’ll have some other, for he must not live.
Who’s this?
My lord Mazeres, discontent?
He’s been to seek me twice, and privately.
I wonder at the business.
I’m no statesman:
if I be, ’tis more than I know.
I protest therefore, I dare
not call it in question.
What should he make with me?
I’ll discover myself to him.
If th’other come i’th’ mean
time, so I may be caught bravely; yet ’tis scarce the
hour.
I’ll put it to the trial.
Roxano in my judgement had been fittest,
And farthest from suspèct of such a deed,
Because he keeps i’th’ castle.
My loved lord.
Roxano!
The same, my lord.
I was to seek thee twice.
Tell me Roxano, have I any power in thee?
Do I move there, or any part of me
Flow in thy blood?
As far as life, my lord.
As far as love, man, I ask no further.
Touch me then, my lord, And try my mettle.
First, there’s gold for thee,
After which follow favour, eminence,
And all those gifts which fortune calls her own.
Well, my lord.
There’s one Tymethes, son to the banished King,
Lives about court; Zenarchus gives him grace.
That fellow’s my disease.
I thrive not with him.
He’s like a prison chain shook in my ears.
I take no sleep for him; his favours mad me.
My honours and my dignities are dreams
When I behold him.
That right arm can ease me.
I will not boast my bounties, but forever
Live rich and happy.
Thou art wise; farewell.
Hmm, what news is here now?
‘Thou art wise;
farewell’?
By my troth, I think it is a part of wisdom
to take gold when it is offered.
Many wise men will
do’t: that I learned of my learnèd counsel.
This is
worth thinking on now.
To kill Tymethes, so strangely
beloved by a lady, and so monstrously detested by a
lord?
Here’s gold to bring Tymethes, and here’s gold to
kill Tymethes.
Ay, let me see, which weighs heaviest?
By my faith, I think the killing gold will carry’t!
I shall,
like many a bad lawyer, run my conscience upon the
greatest fee: who gives most is like to fare best.
I like my
safety so much the worse in this business in that Lord
Mazeres is his professed enemy.
He’s the King’s bosom:
he blows his thoughts into him.
And I had rather be
torn with whirlwinds than fall into any of their furies.
Troth, as far as I can see, the wisest course is to play
the knave, lay open this venery, betray him.—But see,
my lord again.
Hast thou thought of me?
May I do good upon thee?
I’ll out of recreation make thee worthy,
Play honours to thy hand.
My lord?
Art thou resolved an I will be thy lord?
It will appear I am so.
Be proud of your revenge before I name it.
Never was man so fortunate in his hate.
I’ll give you a whole age but to think how.
Thou mak’st me thirst.
Tymethes meets me here.
Here?
Excellent!
On, Roxano: he meets thee here .
. .
I meant at first to betray all to you, sir:
Understand that, my lord.
I’faith, I do.
Then thus, my lord—he comes.
Withdraw behind the lodge; relate it briefly.
A delicate sweet creature?
’Slight, who should it be?
I must not know her name, nor see her face?
It may be some trick to have my bones bastinadoed well,
and so sent back again.
What say you to a blanketting?
Faith, so ’twere done by a lady and her chambermaids I
care not, for if they toss me i’th’ blankets I’ll toss them
i’th’ sheets, and that’s one for th’other.
A man may
be led into a thousand villainies.
But the fellow swore
enough, and here’s blood apt enough to believe him.
I both admire the deed, and my revenge.
My lord, I’ll make your way.
Thou mak’st thy friend.
Art come?
We meet e’en jump upon a minute.
Ay, but you’ll play the better jumper of the two;
I shall not jump so near as you by a handful.
How!
At a running leap?
That is more hard:
At a running leap you may give me a handful.
So, so, what’s to be done?
Nothing but put this hood over your head.
How?
I never went blindfold before.
You never went otherwise, sir, for all folly is blind.
Besides, sir, when we see the sin we act,
We think each trivial crime a bloody fact.
Well followed of a servingman.
Servingmen always follow their masters, sir.
No, not in their mistresses.
There I leave you, sir.
I desire to be left when I come there, sir.
But faith, sincerely, is there no trick in this?
Prithee deal honestly with me.
Honestly?
if protestation be not honest, 
I know not what to call it.
Why, if she affect me
So truly, she might trust me with her knowledge.
I could be secret to her chief actions: why, I love women
too well—
She’ll trust you the worse for that, sir.
Why, because I love women?
O sir, ’tis most common:
He that loves women, is ne’er true to woman.
Experience daily proves he loveth none
With a true heart, that affects more than one.
Your wit runs nimbly, sir; pray use your pleasure.
Why then, good night, sir.
Mass, the candle’s out.
O sir, the better sports taste best i’th’ night,
And what we do i’th’ dark, we hate i’th’ light.
A good doer mayst thou prove, for thy experience.
Come, give me thy hand.
Thou mayst prove an honest
lad; But however, I’ll trust thee.
O sir, first try me.
But we protract good hours.
Come, follow me, sir.—
Why, this is right your sportive gallants’ prize:
Before they’ll lose their sport, they’ll lose their eyes.
O my fear-fighting blood!
Are you all here?
All at your pleasure, madam.
That’s my wish, and my opinïon
Hath ever been persuaded of your truths,
And I have found you willing t’all employments
We put into your charge.
In our faiths, madam.
For we are bound in duty to your bounty.
Will you to what I shall prescribe swear secrecy?
Try us, sweet lady, and you shall prove our faiths.
To all things that you hear or see,
I swear you all to secrecy.
I pour my life into your breasts;
There my doom or safety rests.
If you prove untrue to all,
Now I rather choose to fall
With loss of my desire, than light
Into the tyrant’s wrathful spite.
But in vain I doubt your trust.
I never found your hearts but just.
On this book your vows arrive,
And, as in truth, in favour thrive.
We wish no higher; so we swear.
Like jewels all your vows I’ll wear.
Here, take this paper; there those secrets dwell.
Go read your charge, which I should blush to tell.
All’s sure; I nothing doubt of safety now,
To which each servant hath combined his vow.
Roxano, that begins it trustily—
I cannot choose but praise him.
He’s so needful.
There’s nothing can be done about a lady
But he is for it.
Honest Roxano!
Even from our head to feet he’s so officious.
The time draws on.
I feel the minute’s here.
No clock so true as love that strikes in fear.
How far lack I yet of my blind pilgrimage?
Whist, Roxano!
You are at your— In, my lord, away:
I’ll help you to a disguise.
Enough.
Methinks I walk in a vault all underground.
And now your long lost eyes again are found.
Good morrow, sir.
By the mass, the day breaks.
Rest here, my lord, and you shall find content
Catch your desires; stay here, they shall be sent.
Though it be night, ’tis morning to that night
Which brought me hither.
Ha!
The ground spread with arras?
What place is this?
Rich hangings?
Fair room gloriously furnished?
Lights and their lustre?
Riches and their splendour?
’Tis no mean creature’s, these dumb tokens witness.
Troth, I begin t’affect my hostess better.
I love her in her absence, though unknown,
For courtly form that’s here observed and shown.
Valesta?
Yes, the same.
’Tis my lady’s pleasure
You give to me your coat and visor, and attend without
Till she employ you.
So, now this disguise
Serves for my lord Mazeres, for he watches
But fit occasion.—Lecher, now beware.
Securely sit and fearless quaff and eat:
You’ll find sour sauce still, after your sweet meat.
The servants all in visors?
By this light,
I do admire the carriage of her love—
For I account that woman above wise
Can sin and hide the shame from a man’s eyes.
They never do their easy sex more wrong
Than when they venture fame upon man’s tongue.
Yet I could swear concealment in love’s plot,
But happy woman that believes me not.
Whate’er is spoke, o’er to be spoke seems fit.
All still concludes her happiness and wit.
This banquet from her own hand rèceived grace,
Herself prepared it for you—as appears
By the choice sweets it yields, able to move
A man past sense to the delights of love.
I bid you welcome as her most prized guest,
First to this banquet, next to pleasure’s feast.
Whoe’er she be, we thank her and commend
Her care and love to entertain a friend.
That speaks her sex’s rareness, for to woman
The darkest path love treads is clear and common.
She wishes your content may be as great
As if her presence filled that other seat.
Convey my thanks to her, and fill some wine.
My lord?
My lord Mazeres caught the office.
I can’t but laugh to see how well he plays
The devil in a visor,
Damns where he crouches.
Little thinks the prince
Under that face lurks his life’s enemy.
Yet he but keeps the fashion: great men kill
As flatterers stab, who laugh when they mean ill.
Now could I poison him fitly, aptly, rarely.
My vengeance speaks me happy: there it goes.
Some wine!
It comes, my lord.
My lady begun to you, sir, and doth commend
This to your heart, and with it her affection.
I’ll pledge her thankfully.
There!—Remove that.
And in this my revenge must be removed
Where first I left it.
Now my abusèd wrath
Pursues thy ruin in this dangerous path.
That cup hath quite dashed my lord Mazeres.
Return my faith, my reverence, my respect,
And tell her this, which courteously I find:
She hides her face, but lets me see her mind.
I would not taste of such a banquet to feel
that which follows it for the love of an empress.
’Tis
more dangerous to be a lecher than to enter upon a
breach.
Yet how securely he munches!
His thoughts are sweeter than the very meats before him.
He little dreams of his destructïon,
His horrid fearful ruin, which cannot be withstood.
The end of venery is disease or blood.
I have not known one happier for his pleasure
Than in that state we are.
’Tis a strange trick,
And sweetly carried.
By this light, a delicate creature!
And should have a good face, if all hit right.
For they that have good bodies and bad faces
Were all mismatched, and made up in blind places.
The wind and tide serve, sir; you have lighted
Upon a sea of pleasure.
Here’s your sail, sir,
And your top streamer: a fair-wrought shirt and nightcap.
I shall make A sweet voyage of this.
Ay, if you knew all, sir.
Is not all known yet?
What’s to be told?
Five hundred crowns in the shirt sleeve in gold.
How?
’Tis my good lady’s pleasure.
No clouds eclipse her bounty; she shines clear.
Some like that pleasure best that costs most dear.
Yet I think your lordship is not of that mind now.
You like that best that brings a banquet with it,
And five hundred crowns.
Ay, by this light do I.
And I think thou art of my mind.
We jump somewhat near, sir.
But what does she mean to reward me aforehand?
I may prove a eunuch now, for aught she knows.
O sir, I ne’er knew any of your hair but he was
absolute at the game.
Faith, we are much of a colour.
But here’s a
note; what says it?
Our love and bounty shall increase
So long as you regard our peace.
Unless your life you would forego,
Who we are, seek not to know.
Enjoy me freely: for your sake
This dangerous shift I undertake.
Be therefore wise; keep safe your breath.
You cannot see me under death.
I’d be loth to venture so far for the sight of any creature
under heaven.
Nay, sir, I think you may see a thousand faces better cheap.
Well, I will shift me instantly, and be content
With my groping fortune.
O sir, you’ll grope to purpose.
I’ll after thee,
And see the measure of my vengeance upheaped.
His ruin is my charge.
I have seen that
This night would make one blush thorough this visor.
Like lightning in a tempest her lust shows,
Or drinking drunk in thunder, horrible—
For on this act a thousand dangers wait.
The King will seize him in his burning fury
And seal his vengeance on his reeking breast.
Though I make pander’s use of ear and eye,
No office’ vile to damn mine enemy.
This course is but the first.
’Twill not rest there;
The next shall change him into fire and air.
Nay, did e’er subtlety match it?
’Slight, led to a lady hoodwinked,
Placèd in state and banqueted in visors!
All, by this light: but all this nothing was
To the delicious pleasures of her bed.
Who should this be?
Nay, enquire not, brother.
I’d give one eye to see her with the other.
Seest thou this jewel?
In the midst of night
I slipped it from her veil, unfelt of her.
’T may be so kind unto me as to bring
Her beauty to my knowledge.
Canst not guess at her,
Nor at the place?
At neither, for my heart.
Why, I’ll tell thee, man, ’twas handled with such art,
Such admired cunning, what with my blindness
And their general darkness, that when mine eyes
Received their liberty I was ne’er the nearer.
To them in full form I appeared unshrouded,
But all their sights to me were masked and clouded.
’Fore heaven, I do admire the cunning on’t.
Nay, you cannot outvie my admiration.
I had a feeling on’t, beyond your passion.
Well, blow this over; see, our sister comes.
Art sure, Mazeres, that he courts our daughter?
I’m sure of more, my lord: she favours him.
That beggar?
Worse my lord, that villain traitor—
And yet worse my lord.
How?
Pardon, my lord, a riper time
Shall bring him forth.
Behold him there, my lord.
Dares she so far forget respect to us,
And dim her own lustre to give him grace?
Favours are grown to custom ’twixt ’em both:
Letters, close banquets, whisperings, private meetings.
I’ll make ’em dangerous meetings.
In faith, my lord, I’ll have this jewel.
’Tis not my gift, lady.
What’s that, Mazeres?
Marry, my lord, she courtly begs a jewel of him,
Which he keeps back as courtly with fair words.
I’ve sworn, my lord.
Why, upon that condition
You’ll keep it safe and close from all strange eyes,
Not wronging me, ’tis yours.
I swear.
It shall suffice.
’Tis hers, my lord, at which they part in kisses.
I’ll make those meetings bitter.
Both shall rue.
We have found Mazeres to this minute true.
No trick to see this lady?
Heart of ill fortune!
The jewel that was begged from me too was
The hope I had to gain her wished-for knowledge.
Well, here’s a heart within will not be quiet.
The eye is the sweet feeder of the soul;
When the taste wants, that keeps the memory whole.
’Tis bad to be in darkness, all know well;
Then not to see her, what doth it want of hell?
What says the note?
Unless your life you would forego,
Whom we are, seek not to know.
Pish, all idle!
As if she’d suffer death to threaten me
Whom she so bounteously and firmly loves!
No trick?
Excellent, ’twill fit; make use of that.
Enough, thou’rt honest.
I affect thee much.
Go, train him to his ruin.
Let me alone, my lord: doubt not I’ll train him.
Perhaps sir, I have the art.
O, I know thy mind.
The further lodge?
Enough, I’ll meet thee presently.
Why so: I like one that will make an end—
of himself at few words.
A man that hath a quick perseverance in ill,
A leaping spirit, he’ll run through horror’s jaws
To catch a sin.
But to o’ertake a virtue
He softly paces, like a man that’s sent
Some tedious, dark, unprofitable journey.
Corrupt is nature; she loves nothing more
Than what she most should hate.
There’s nothing springs
Apace in man but grey hairs, cares, and sins.
I’ll see her, come what can.
But what can prove?
She cannot seek my death that seeks my love.
My lord, what is the matter?
I know not what;
The King sent.
Well, we obey.
Here comes his highness.
How now, what’s she?
I, my lord?
Your highness
Knew me once: your most obedient daughter.
They lie that tell me so; this is not she.
No, my lord?
No, for as thou art I know thee not,
And I shall strive still to forget thee more.
Thou neither bear’st in memory my respects
Nor thy own worths.
How can we think of thee
But as of a dejected worthless creature?—
So far beneath our grace and thy own lustre,
That we disdain to know thee.
Was there no choice ’mong our selected nobles
To make thy favourite, besides Tymethes?
Son to our enemy, a wretch, a beggar,
Dead to all fortunes, honours or their hopes;
Besides his breath, worth nothing.
Abject wretch,
To place so vigorously thy affection
On him can ne’er requite it!
Deny’t not.
We know the favours thou hast given him:
Pledges of love, close letters, private meetings,
And whisperings are customary ’twixt you.
Come, which be his gifts?
Whereabout lie his pledges?
Your grace hath been injuriously informed.
I ne’er receivèd pledge.
Impudent creature,
When in our sight and hearing shamefully
Undervaluing thy best honours and setting by
All modesty of blood thou begged’st a jewel of him.
O pardon me, my lord, I had forgot: here ’tis.
That is the same, and all that e’er was his.
Ha!
This!
How came this hither?
I gave it you, my lord.
Who gave it thee?
Tymethes.
He!
Who gave it him?
I know not that, my lord.
Then here it sticks.—Mazeres!
My lord?
’Tis my Queen’s, my Queen’s, Mazeres.
How to him came this?
I can resolve your highness.
Can Mazeres?
He is some ape: the husk falls from him now,
And you shall know his inside.
He’s a villain,
A traitor to the pleasures of your bed.
O, I shall burst with torment.
He’s received this night
Into her bosom.
I feel a whirlwind in me
Ready to tear the frame of my mortality.
I traced him to the deed.
And saw it done?
I abused my eyes in the true survey on’t,
Tainted my hearing with lascivious sounds;
My loyalty did prompt me to be sure
Of what I found so wicked and impure.
’Tis springtide in my gall.
All my blood’s bitter—
Puh, lungs too.
This night.
Lodovico!
My lord.
How cam’st thou up?
Let’s hear.
My lord, my first beginning was a broker.
A knave from the beginning; there’s no hope of him.
Sertorio!
Here, my lord.
We know thee just.
How cam’st thou up?
Let’s hear.
From no desert 
That I can challenge but your highness’ favour.
Thou art honest in that answer.
Go:
Report we are forty leagues off rid forth:
Spread it about the castle cunningly.
I’ll do it faithfully, my lord.
Do’t cunningly.
Go!
If thou shouldst do’t faithfully, thou liest.
I’m lost by violence through all my senses.
I’m blind with rage.—Mazeres, guide me forth.
I tread in air, and see no foot nor path;
I’ve lost myself, yet cannot lose my wrath.
What have I heard?
It dares not be but true.
Tymethes taken in adulterate trains,
And with the Queen, my mother?
Now I hate him,
As beauty abhors years, or usurers charity.
He does appear unto my eye a leper 
Full of sin’s black infection, foul adultery.
Cursèd be the hour in which I first did grace him
And let Mazeres starve in my disdain,
That hath so long observed me with true love,
Whose loyalty in this approves the same.
Madam.
My love?
‘My lord’ I should say, but would say ‘my love’.
I do beseech your grace for what I’ve done
Lay no oppressing censure upon me.
I could not but in honesty reveal it,
Not envying in that he was my rival
Nor in the force of any ancient grudge,
But as the deed in its own nature craved,
So ’mong the rest it was revealed to me, 
Appearing so detested that yourself,
Gracious and kind, had you but seen the manner,
Would have thrown by all pity and remorse
And took my office, or one more in force.
Rise, dear Mazeres, in our favours rise.
So far am I from censure to reprove thee
That in my hate to him I choose and love thee.
If constant service may be called desert,
I shall deserve.
Man hath no better part.
Why, this was happily observed and followed.—
The King will to the castle late tonight
And tread through all the vaults; I must attend.
I wish that at first sight thou’dst forced his end.
’Tis better thus.
So my revenge imports.
Now thrive my plots!
The end shall make me great:
She mine, the crown sits here.
I am then complete.
So, leave us here awhile; bear back the light.
I would not be discovered if he come.
You know his entertainment.
So, be gone.
I am not cheerful, troth, what point soe’er
My powers arrive at.
I desire a league
With desolate darkness, and disconsolate fancies.
There is no music in my soul tonight.
What should I fear, when all my servants’ faiths
Sleep in my bounty, and no bribes nor threats
Can wake ’em from my safety?
For the King,
He’s forty leagues rode forth; I heard it lately.
Yet heaviness, like a tyrant, proud in night,
Usurps my power, rules where it hath no right.
Methinks this a longer voyage than the first?
Pleasures once tasted makes the next seem worse.
Is that the trick?
O sir, experience proves it.
You came at first to enjoy what you ne’er knew;
Now all is but the same whate’er you do.
I’ll prove that false: the sight of her is new.
I have forgot a business to my lord Mazeres;
My safety to the King relies upon’t.
You are in the house, my lord: this is the withdrawing room.
I see nothing.
No matter, sir, as long as you have feeling enough.
Is the hood off?
’Tis here in my hand, sir.
I must crave pardon, leave you here awhile.
But as you love my safety and your own
Remove not from this room till my return.
Well, here’s my hand: I will not.
’Tis enough, sir.
Hist, art gone?
Then boldly I step forth,
Cunning discoverer of an unknown beauty
As subtle as her plot.
Thou art masked too:
Show me a little comfort, in this condensive darkness.
Play the flatterer: laugh in my face.
Why, here’s enough to pèrfect all my wishes.
With this I taste of that forbidden fruit
Which, as she says, death follows; death, ’twill sting.
Soft, what room’s this?
Let’s see, ’tis not the former
I was entertained in; no, it somewhat differs:
Rich hangings still, court deckings, ay, and all—
O all that can be in man’s wish comprised
Is in thy love immortal, in thy graces!
I am not the same flesh; my touch is altered.
Hast thou betrayed me?
What hast thou attempted?
Nothing that can be prejudicïal
To the sweet peace of those illustrious graces.
O my most certain ruin!
Admirèd lady, hear me, hear my vow.
O miserable youth, none saves thee now.
By that which man holds dearest, dreadful Queen,
And all that can be in a vow contained,
I’ll prove as true, secret, and vigilant
As ever man observed with serious virtue 
The dreadful call of his departing soul.
Your own soul to your secrets shall not prove more true
Than mine to it, to them, to all, to you.
O misery of affection built on breath!
Were I as far past my belief in heaven
As in man’s oaths, I were the foulest devil.
May I eat and ne’er be nourishèd,
Live and know nothing, love without enjoying,
If ever—
Come, this is more than needs.
There’s comfort then.
You that profess such truth, shall I enjoin you
To one poor penance then to try your faith?
Be’t what it will, command it.
Spend but this hour, wherein you have offended,
In true repentance of your sin, and all
Your hasty youth stands guilty of—and being clear,
You shall enjoy that which you hold most dear.
And if this penance I perform not truly,
May I henceforth ne’er be received to favour.
Why then, I’ll leave you to your task awhile.
Most wretched, doubtful, strange-distracted woman,
E’en drawn in pieces betwixt love and fear,
I weep in thought of both.
Bold venturous youth,
Twice I writ death, yet would he seek to know me.
He’ll make no conscience where his oaths bestow me.
I’m glad all’s so well past, and she appeased.
I swear I did expect a harder penance
When she began to enjoin me.
Why, this is wholesome
For soul and body, though I seldom use it.
Her wisdom is as pleasing as her beauty.
I never knew affection hastier born,
With more true art and less suspicïon.
It so amazed me to know her my mistress,
I had no power to close the light again,
Unhappy that I was.—Peace, here she comes.
Down to thy penance: think of thy whole youth.
From the first minute that the womb conceived me
To this full-heapèd hour, I do repent me,
With heart as penitent as a man dissolving,
Of all my sins, born with me, and born of me,
Dishonest thoughts and sleights, the paths of youth.
So thrive in mercy as I end in truth!
Fly to thy wish!
I pray it may be given.
Man in a twinkling is in earth and heaven.
I dealt not like a coward with thy soul,
Nor took it unprepared.
I gave him time to put his armour on
And sent him forth like a celestial champion.
I loved thee with more care and truer moan,
Since thou must die, to taste more deaths than one.
Too much by this pity and love confesses.
Had any warning fast’ned on thy senses, [ ].
Rash, unadvisèd youth, whom my soul weeps for,
How oft I told thee this attempt was death!
Yet would’st thou venture on, fond man, and knew?
But what destruction will not youth pursue?
Here long mightst thou have lived, been loved, enjoyed,
Had not thy will thy happiness destroyed!
Thought’st thou by oaths to have thy deeds well borne?
Thou shouldst have come when man was ne’er forsworn.
They are dangerous now; witness this breach of thine.
Who’s false to his own faith, will ne’er keep mine.
We must be safe, young man, the deeds unknown.
There are more loves; honours, no more than one.
Yet spite of death, I’ll kiss thee.
O strange ill, 
That for our fears we should our comforts kill!
Whom shall I trust with this poor bleeding body?
Yonder’s a secret vault runs through the castle;
There for a while convey him.
Hapless boy,
That never knew how dear ’twas to enjoy!
O I’m confounded everlastingly,
Damned to a thousand tortures in that sight.
What shall I frame?—My lord!
What’s she?
O my sweet dearest lord!
Thy name?
Thy poor affrighted and endangered Queen.
O, I know thee now.
Did not your majesty hear the piteous shrieks
Of an enforcèd lady?
Yes, whose were they?
Mine, my most worthy lord.
Behold this villain,
Sealed with his just desert.
Light here, my king.
This violent youth, whom till this night I saw not,
Being, as it seems, acquainted with the footsteps
Of that dark passage, broke through the vault upon me
And with a secret lantern searched me out,
And seized me at my orisons, alone,
And bringing me by violence to this room,
Far from my guard or any hope of rescue,
Intending here the ruin of my honour;
But in the strife, as the good gods ordained it,
Reaching for succour, I lighted on a pistol,
Which I presumed was not without his charge.
Then I redeemed mine honour from his lust,
So he that sought my fall lies in the dust.
O, let me embrace thee for a brave, unmatchable,
Precious, unvalued, admirable—whore.
Ha!
What says my lord?
Come hither.
Yet draw nearer.
How came this man
To’s end?
I would hear that.
I would learn cunning.
Tell me that I may wonder, and so lose thee.
There is no art like this.
Let me partake
A subtlety no devil can imitate.
Speak: why is all so contrary to time?
He down and you up?
Ha, why thus?
I am sorry for my lord; I understand him not.
The deed is not so monstrous in itself 
As is the art which ponders home the deed.
The cunning doth amaze me past the sin,
That he should fall before my rage begin.
My lord?
Come hither yet.
One of those left hands give me;
Thou hast no right at all.
What would my lord?
Nothing but put a ring upon a finger.
That’s a wrong finger for a ring, my lord.
And what was he on whom you bounteously
Bestowed this jewel?
I do not like that word.
Look well upon’t: dost know it?
Ay, and start.
O heaven, how came this hither?
Your highness gave me this; this is mine own.
’Tis the same ring, but yet not the same stone.
Mystical strumpet, dost thou yet presume
Upon thy subtle strength?
Shak’st thou not yet?
Or is it only art makes women constant,
Whom nature makes so loose?
I looked for gracious lightning from thy cheeks
(I see none yet), for a relenting eye 
(I can see no such sight).
Lust keeps in all.—
My witness!
Where’s my witness?
Rise in the same form.
O I’m betrayed.
Is not yon woman an adulteress?
Yes, my good lord.
Was not this fellow catched for her desire?
Brought in a mist?
Banqueted and received
To all her amplest pleasures!
True, my lord:
I brought him, saw him feasted and received—
Down, down, we have too much.
O ’tis Roxano.
So, by this sleight I have deceived ’em both.
I’m took for him I strive to make her loathe.
Needs hear more witnesses?
I’ll call up more.
O no, here lies a witness ’gainst myself
Sooner believed than all their hirèd faiths.
Doom me unto my death, only except
The lingering execution of your look;
Let me not live tormented in that brow.
I do confess.
O, I felt no quick till now.
All witnesses to this were but dead flesh;
I was insensible of all but this.
Would I had given my kingdom, so conditioned
That thou hadst ne’er confessed it.
Now I stand by the deed, see all in action,
The close conveyance, cunning passages,
The artful fetch, the whispering, close disguising,
The hour, the banquet, and the bawdy tapers,
All stick in mine eye together.
Yet thou shalt live.
Torment me not with life; it asks but death.
O hadst thou not confessed!
Hadst thou no sleight?
Where was thy cunning there?
I see it now in thy confessïon.
Thou shalt not die as long as this is meat.
Thou killed’st a buck which thou thyself shalt eat.
Dear sir?
Here’s deer struck dead with thy own hand;
’Tis venison for thy own tooth.
Thou know’st the relish:
A dearer place hath been thy taster.
Ho!
Sertorio!
Lodovico!
Here, sir.
Drag hence that body; see it quartered straight.
No living wrath can I extend upon’t,
Else torments, horrors, gibbets, racks and wheels
Had with a thousand deaths presented him
Ere he had tasted one.—Yet thou shalt live.
Here, take this taper lighted, kneel, and weep.
I’ll try which is spent first, that or thine eye.
I’ll provide food for thee; thou shalt not die.
If there be hell for sins that men commit,
Marry a strumpet and she keeps the pit.
I feared this misery long before it came.
My ominous dreams and fearful dreadfulness 
Promised this issue long before ’twas born.
Yonder she kneels, little suspecting me
The neat discoverer of her venery.
I were full safe had I Roxano’s life,
Which in this stream I fish for.—How now, lady?
So near the earth suits not a living queen.
Under the earth were safer and far happier.
What is’t that can drive you to such discomforts,
To prize your glories at so mean a rate?
The treachery of my servants, good my lord.
Dare they prove treacherous (most ignoble vassals!)
To the sweet peace of so divine a mistress?
I’m sure one villain, whom I dearly loved,
Of whom my trust had made election chief,
Perfidiously betrayed me to the fury 
Of my tempestuous unappeasèd lord.
Let me but know him, that I may bestow
My service to your grace upon his heart,
And thence deserve a mistress like yourself.
O me, too soon behold him!
Madam, stand by, 
Let him not see the light.
Now I expect reward.
He dies, were he my kinsman, for that guilt,
Though ’twere as far to’s heart as ’tis to th’ hilt.
Ha?
What was that?
There’s a reward with a vengeance.
Fall villain, for betraying of thy lady.
Such things must never creep about the earth
To poison the right use of service—a treacher!
This is some poor revenge.
Thanks, good my lord.
Into that cave with him, from whence he rose
Not long since and betrayed me to the King.
O villain, in, and overtake thy soul.
Here’s a perplexèd breast: let that warm steel
Perform but the like service upon me,
And live the rarest friend to a queen’s wish.
O pardon me, that were too full of evil.
I threat not angels, though I smite the devil:
Doubt not your peace; the King will be appeased.
There I’ll bestow my service.
We are pleased.
As much as comes to nothing; I’ll not sue
To urge the King from that I urged him to.
Betrayed where I reposed most trust?
O heaven,
There is no misery fit match for mine.
So, bring ’em forward yet, there; there bestow ’em.
Before her eyes lay the divided limbs
Of her desirèd paramour.
So.
You’re welcome,
Lady, you see your cheer: fine flesh, coarse fare.
Sweet was your lust; what can be bitter there?
By heaven, no other food thy taste shall have,
Till in thy bowels those corpse find a grave.
Which to be sure of, come: I’ll lock thee safe
From the world’s pity.—Hang those quarters up!—
The bottom drink’s the worst in pleasure’s cup.
O my Tymethes!
Truest joy on earth!
Hath thy fate proved so flinty, so perverse,
To the sweet spring both of thy youth and hopes?
This was Mazeres’ spite, that cursèd rival.
And if I fail not, his own plot shall shower
Upon his bosom like a falling tower.
My worthy lord.
O, you should have seen us sooner.
Why my lord?
The quarters of your friend passed by in triumph,
A sight that I presume had pleased you well.
I call a villain to my father’s pleasure
No friend of mine.
The sight had pleased me better
Had I, not like Mazeres, run my hate
Into the sin before it grew to act,
And killed it ere’t had knotted.
’Twas rare service
(If your vexed majesty conceive it right)
In politic Mazeres, serving more
In this discovery his own vicious malice
Than any true peace that should make you perfect— 
Suffering the hateful treason to be done
He might have stopped in his confusïon.
Most certain.
Good your majesty, bethink you
In manly temper and considerate blood:
Went he the way of loyalty or your quiet, 
After he saw the courtesies exceed,
T’abuse your peace, and trust ’em with the deed?
O no, none but a traitor would have done it.
For my lord, weigh’t indifferently.
I do, I do.
What makes it heinous, burdensome and monstrous,
Fills you with such distractions, breeds such furies
In your incensèd breast, but the deed doing?
O!
Th’intent had been sufficient for his death,
And that full satisfaction; but the act— 
Insufferable.—
Sertorio!
Where’s Sertorio?
My lord?
Seek out Mazeres suddenly.
Peace, Zenarchus.
Let me alone to trap him.
It may prove.
Behold, my friend, how I express my love.
O villain!
Had he pierced him at first sight,
Where I have one grief, I had missed ten thousand by’t.
I dreamt of some new honours
For my late service, and I wondered how
He could keep off so long from my desert.
Mazeres?
My loved lord.
I am forgetful.
I am in thy debt some dignities, Mazeres.
What shift shall we make for thee?
Thy late service
Is warm still in our memory and dear favour.
Prithee, discover to’s the manner how
Thou took’st ’em subtly.
I was received Into a waiter’s room, my lord.
Thou wast!
And in a visor helped to serve the banquet.
Ha, ha!
Saw him conveyed into a chamber privately.
And still thou let’st him run?
I let him play, my lord.
Ha, ha, ha!
I watched still near, till her arms clasped him.
And there thou let’st him rest?
There he was caught, my lord.
So art thou here.—
Drag him to execution.
He shall die
With tortures ’bove the thought of tyranny.
No words are able to express my gladness.
’Tis such a high born rapture that the soul
Partakes it only.
My lord Mazeres led Unto his death?
It proves too true, dear princess.
Cursed be the mouth that doomed him, and forever
Blasted the hand that parts him from his life.
Was there none fit to practise tyranny on
But whom our heart elected?
Misery of love!
I must not live to think on’t.
Here’s my sister.
I could not bring that news will please her better.—
My news brings that command over your passions,
You must be merry.
Have you warrant for’t, brother?
Yes, strong enough, i’faith.
Hear me: 
Mazeres By this time is at his everlasting home.
Where’er his body lies, I struck the stroke.
I wrought a bitter pill that quickly choked him.
O me, my soul will out!—Some wine there, ho!
Wine for our sister!—for the news is worth it.
It will prove dear to both.—So, give it me.
Now leave us.
Revenge ne’er brought forth a more happy issue
Than I think mine to be.
I’m setting forth, Mazeres.—Here, Zenarchus!
Thou art not like this hour, jovial.
I shall be after this.
That does’t, if any.
Wine doth both help defects, and causeth many.
Here’s to the deed, faith, of our last revenge.
Dying men prophesy: faith, ’tis our last end.
Now I must tell you, brother, that I hate you,
In that you have betrayed my loved Mazeres.
What’s this?
His deed was loyal, his discovery just:
He brought to light a monster and his lust.
Nay, if you grow
So strumpet-like in your behaviour to me,
I’ll quickly cool that insolence.
Peace, peace.
There is a champion fights for me unseen;
I need not fear thy threats.
Indeed no harlot  But has her champion, besides bawd and varlet.
O!
Why, law you now!
Such gear will ne’er thrive with you.
I’m sick of thy society, poison to mine eyes.
’Tis lower in thy breast the poison lies.
How?
’Tis for Mazeres.
O you virtuous powers!
What, a right strumpet?
Poison, under love?
That man can ne’er be safe that divides love.
Nor she be honest can so soon impart.
O ’ware that woman that can shift her heart!
Ha?
Thunder?
And thou marrow-melting blast,
Quick-wingèd lightning, and thou blazing star,
I like not thy prodigious bearded fire.
Thy beams are fatal.
Ha!
Behold the influence
Of all their malice in my children’s ruins!
Their states malignant powers have envìed,
And both in haste, struck with their envies, died.
’Tis ominous.—Within there!
Here, my lord.
Convey those bodies awhile from my sight.
Both dead, my lord.
Yes, and we safe; our death we need less fear.
Usurper’s issue oft proves dangerous:
We depose others, and they poison us.
I have found it on recòrds; ’tis better thus.
My lord, this castle is but slightly guarded.
’Tis as I hoped and wished.
Now bless us heaven!
What horrid and inhuman spectacle
Is yonder that presents itself to sight?
It seems three quarters of a man hung up.
What tyranny hath been exercised of late?
I dare not venture on.
Fear not, my lord: our habits give us safety.
Behold, the tyrant maketh toward us.
Holy and reverent pilgrims, welcome!
Bold strangers, by the tempest beaten in.
Most welcome still.
We are but stewards for such guests as you:
What we possess is yours, to your wants due.
We are only rich for your necessities.
A generous, free, and charitable mind 
Keeps in thy bosom, to poor pilgrims kind.
’Tis time of day to dine, my friends.—Sertorio!
My lord?
Our food.
’Tis ready for your highness.
Sit, pray sit, religious men, right welcome
Unto our cates.
Grave sir, I have observed 
You waste the virtue of your serious eye
Too much on such a worthless object as that is.
A traitor when he lived called that his flesh;
Let’t hang.
Here’s to you!
We are the oldest here.
Round let it go.
Feed, if you like your cheer.
My lord.
How now?
Ready, my lord.
Sit merry.
Where’er I look, these limbs are in mine eye.
Some wretch on whom he wrought his tyranny.
Hard was his fate to ’light into his mercy.
Peace, he comes.
I perceive strangers more desire to see
An object than the fare before them set.
But since your eyes are serious suitors grown,
I will discourse; what’s seen shall now be known.
Your bounty every way conquers poor strangers.
Yon creature whom your eyes so often visit
Held mighty sway over our powers and thoughts;
Indeed we were all hers.
Besides her graces, there were all perfections:
Unless she spoke, no music; till her wishes
Brought forth a monster, a detested issue,
Poisoning the thoughts I held of her.
She did from her own ardour undergo
Adulterous baseness with my professed foe.
Her lust strangely betrayed, I ready to surprise them,
Set on fire by the abuse, I found his life
Cunningly shifted by her own dear hand
And far enough conveyed from my revenge.
Unnaturally she first abused my heart,
And then prevented my revenge by art.
Yet there I left not.
Though his trunk were cold,
My wrath was flaming, and I exercised
New vengeance on his carcass, and gave charge
The body should be quartered and hung up.
’Twas done.
This as a penance I enjoined her to:
To taste no other sustenance, no nor airs,
Till her love’s body be consumed in hers.
The sin was great; so is the penance grievous.
Our vow is signed.
And was he Lydian born?
He was no less.
Son to mine enemy,
A banished king; Tymethes was his name.
O me, my son Tymethes!
Passion may spoil us.—Sir, we oft have heard
Of that old king, his father, and that justly
This kingdom was by right due to his sway.
It was; I think it was, till we (called in)
By policy and force deceived his confidence,
Showed him a trick of war and turned him out.
Sin’s boast is worse than sin.
All’s sure, the guards are seized on.
Good.
The passage strongly guarded.
Holy sir, what’s he?
Our brother, a poor pilgrim, that gives notice
Of a religious father that attends
To bear us company in our pilgrimage.
O ho, ’tis good, ’tis very good.
Alas, poor lady!
It makes me weep to see what food she eats.
I know your mercy will remit this penance.
Never, our vow’s irrevocable, never.
The lecher must be swallowed rib by rib.
His flesh is sweet; it melts, and goes down merrily.
Ha?
What are these?
Speranza.
Ha?
Villain, this minute looses thee, thou tyrant.
Pilgrims wear arms?
The old King?
And Lapyrus?
Betrayed?
Confounded?
O, I must die forsworn.
Break, vow; bleed, whore.
There is my jealousy flown.
O happy man, ’tis more revenge to me
Than all your aims: I have killed my jealousy.
I have nothing now to care for.
More than hell
’T had been if you had struck me ere she fell.
I had left her to your lust; the thought is bitterness.
But she first fall’n—ha, ha, ha!
Die, cruel murderous tyrant.
So laugh away this breath.
My lust was ne’er more pleasing than my death.
As full possessed as ever, and as rich
In subjects’ hearts and voices, we present thee
The complete sway of this usurpèd kingdom.
I am so borne betwixt the violent streams
Of joy and passion, I forget my state.
To all: our thanks and favours, and what more
We are in debt, to all your free consent
We will discharge in happy government.
The peaceful’st reign that ever prince enjoyed—
Already a petition?
Suitors begin betimes.
We are scarce warm in our good fortune yet.
What are you?
Unworthiest of all the joys this hour brings forth.
Our dearest Queen?
Your poor distressèd Queen.
O let me light upon that constant breast,
And kiss thee till my soul melt on thy lips.
Our joys were perfect, stood Tymethes there.
We are old; this kingdom wants a hopeful heir.
Your joys are perfect, though he stand not there,
And your wish blessed: behold a hopeful heir!
Stand not amazed: ’tis Manophes.
How just the gods are, who in their due time
Return what they took from us.
Happy hour!
Heaven hath not taken all our happiness;
For though your elder met ill fate, good heaven
Hath thus preserved your younger for your heir.
Prepare those limbs for honourable burial.—
And, noble nephew, all your ill is lost
In your late new-born goodness, which we’ll reward.—
No storm of fate so fierce but time destroys,
And beats back misery with a peal of joys.
WIthdraw, we must haue priuate conference
With our deere husband.
What wouldst thou wife?
Be what I am not, make thee greater farre
Then thou canst aime to be.
Why I am Tarquin.
And I am Tullia what of that?
What Diapasons more in Tarquins name
Then in a Subiects?
or what's Tullia
More in the sound, then to become the name
Of a poore Maide or waiting Gentlewoman?
I am a princesse both by birth and thoughts,
Yet all's but Tullia, theres no resonance
In a bare stile: my title beares no breadth,
Nor hath it any state, oh me, i'me sicke!
Sick Lady?
Sick at heart.
Why my sweete Tullia?
To be a Queene I long, long and am sicke
With ardence, my hot appetite's afire,
Till my swolne feruor be deliuered
Of that great Title Queene, my heart's all royal,
Not to be circumscribed in seruill bounds,
While there's a King that rules the Peers of Rome.
Tarquin makes legs and Tullia curtesies lowe,
Bowes at each nod, and must not neere the state
Without obeysance, oh!
I hate this awe, my prowd heart cannot brooke it.
Heare me wife.
I am no wife of Tarquini if not King:
Oh had God made me man, I would haue mounted
Aboue the base tribunals of the earth,
Vp to the clowdes, for pompeous soueraintie,
Thou art a man, oh beare my royall minde,
Mount heauen and see if Tullia lag behinde,
There is no earth in me, I am all fire,
Were Tarquin so, then should we both aspire.
Oh Tullia, though my body taste of dulnesse,
My soule is wingde: loe I soare as high as thine,
But note what flags our wings!
fortie fiue yeares
The King thy father hath protected Rome.
That makes for vs: the people couet change,
Euen the best things in time grow teadious.
T'would seeme vnnaturall in thee my Tullia,
The reuerend King, thy Father to depose:
A kingdomes quest, makes Sonnes and Fathers foes.
And but by Seruius fall we cannot climbe,
The balme that must annoynt vs is his blood.
Lets laue our browes then in that crimson flood,
We must be bolde and dreadlesse, who aspires,
Mounts by the liues of Fathers, Sonnes, and Sires.
And so must I, since for a kingdomes loue,
Thou canst despise a Father for a Crowne:
Tarquin shall mount, Seruius be tumbled down,
For he vsurpes my state, and first deposde,
My father in my swathed Infancye,
For which he shall be countant to his end.
I haue founded all the Peires and Senators,
and though vnknowne to thee my Tullia,
They all imbrace my faction, and so they
Loue change of state, and new King to obey.
Now is my Tarquin, worthy Tullias grace
Since in my armes, I thus a King embrace.
The King should meete this day in Parliament,
With all the Senates and Estates of Rome:
His place will I assume, and there proclaime,
All our decrees in Royall Tarquins name.
May it please thee Noble Tarquin to attend
The King this day within the high Capitol?
Attend?
We intend this day to see the Capitoll,
You knew our father good Lucretius?
I did my Lord.
Was not I his Sonne?
The Queene my Mother was of royall thoughts
and heart pure, as vnblemisht Innocence.
Why askes my Lord?
Sonnes should succeede their fathers, but anon
You shall heare more, high time that we were gone.
Theres morrall sure in this, Valerius,
Heeres modell, yea, and matter too to breed
Strange meditations in the prouident braines
Of our graue Fathers: some strange proiect liues
This day in Cradle thats but newly borne.
No doubt Colatine, no doubt heeres a giddie world, it Reeles, 
it hath got the staggers, the common-wealth is sicke of an ague, 
of which nothing can cure her but some violent and suddaine affrightment.
The wife of Tarquin would be a Queene, 
nay on my life she is with childe till she be so.
and longes to be brought to bed of a Kingdome, 
I deuine we shall see some scuffling to day in the Capitoll.
If there be any difference among the Princes and Senate, 
whose faction will Valerius follow?
Oh Collatine!
I am a true Cittizen and in this I will best shew my selfe to be one, 
to take part with the stronger.
If Servius ore-come, I am Liegeman to Servius, 
& if Tarquin subdue, I am for Viue Tarquinius.
Valerius, no more, this talke does but keepe vs from the sight of this solemnitie: 
by this the Princes are entring the Capitoll: come, we must attend.
This place is not for fooles, this parliament
assembles not the straines of Ideotisme:
Only the graue and wisest of the land:
Important are th' affaires wee haue in hand.
Hence with that mome.
Brutus forbeare the presence.
For beare the presence, why pra'y?
None are admitted to this graue concourse,
But wise men: nay good Brutus.
Youle haue an emptie parliament then.
Heere is no roome for fooles.
Then what makst thou heere, or he or he?
oh Iupiter?
if this commaund be kept strictly, 
wee shall haue emptie benches: get you home you that are heere, 
for heere will be nothing to doe this day: a generall concourse of wise-men,
tw'as neuer seene since the first Chaos.
Tarquin if the general rule haue no exceptions, 
thou wilt haue an empty Consistory.
Brutus, you trouble vs.
How powerfull am I you renowned Deities, 
that am able to trouble her that troubles a whole Empire?
fooles exempted, & women admitted!
laugh Democritus, 
but haue you nothing to say to Madmen?
Madmen haue heere no place.
Then out a dores with Tarquin: whats hee that may sit in a calme Valley, 
and will choose to repose in a tempestious mountaine, but a madman?
that may liue in tranquilous pleasures, and will seeke out a kingdomes-cares, but a madman?
who would seeke innouation in a common-wealth in publike, 
or be ouer-ruld by a curst wife in priuate, but a foole or a mad-man?
giue me thy hand Tarquins, shal we two be dismist together from the Capitoll?
Restraine his folly.
Driue the frantique hence.
Nay Brutus.
Good Brutus.
Nay soft, soft good blood of the Tarquins, lets haue a few colde words first, 
and I am gone in an instant: I claime the priuiledge of the nobilitie of Rome, 
and by that priuiledge my seate in the Capitol.
I am a Lord by birth, 
my place is as free in the Capitol as Horatius, thine, or thine Lucretius.
Thine Sextus, Arnus thine, or any here: I am a Lord and banish all the Lords from the presence, 
& youle haue few to wait vpon the King but Gentlemen: nay I am easily perswaded then, 
hands off, since you will not haue my company, you shal haue my roome:
My roome indeede, for what I seeme to be,
Brutus is not, but borne great Roome to free.
The state is full of Dropsie, and swolne bigge
With windy vapors, which my sword must pierce,
To purge th'infected blood: bred by the pride
Of these infested blouds, nay now I goe.
Beholde I vanish, since tis Tarquins minde,
One small foole goes, but great fooles leaues behinde 
Tis pittie one so generously deriu'd
Should be depriu'd: his best induements thus,
And want the true directions of the soule.
To leaue these delatorie trifles, Lords,
Now to the publique businesse of the Land,
Lords take your seuerall places.
Not great Tarquin, before the King assume his regall throane
Whose comming we attend.
Hee's come already.
The King?
The King:
Seruius.
Tarquinius:
Seruius is King.
It was by power diuine,
The Throane that long since hee vsurpt is mine.
Heere we enthroane our selues Cathedral state,
Long since detain'd vs, iustly we resume,
Then let our friendes, and such as loue vs, crie
Liue Tarquin and enioy this soueraintie.
Liue Tarquin and enioy this soueraintie.
The King himselfe with such considerate Peeres
As stoutly embrace his faction, being informde
Of Tarquins vsurpation, armed comes,
Neere to the entrance of the Capitoll.
No man giue place, he that dares to arise
And doe him reuerence, we his loue despise.
Traitor.
Vsurper.
Descend.
Sit still.
In Servius name, Romes greate imperiall monarch,
I charge thee Tarquin disinthrone thy selfe.
and throw thee at our feete, prostrate for mercy.
Spoke like a King.
In Tarquins name, now Romes imperiall Monarch,
We charge thee Seruius make free resignation,
Of that archt wreath thou hast vsurpt so long.
Words worth an Empire.
Shal this be brookt my Soueraigne?
Dismount the Traitor.
Touch him he that dares.
Dares!
Dares?
Strumpet, no childe of mine.
Dotard, and not my father.
Kneele to thy King?
Submit thou to thy Queene.
Insufferable treason!
with bright steele
Lop downe these interponents, that withstand
The passage to our throane.
That Cocles dares.
We with our steele, guard Tarquin and this chaire.
A Seruius.
A Tarquin.
Now are we King, indeede our awe is builded
Vpon this royall base, and slaughtered body
Of a dead King; we by his ruine rise
To a Monarchall Throane.
We haue our longing.
My fathers death giues me a second life,
Much better than the first, my birth was seruitud
But this new breath of reigne is large and free,
Welcome my second life of Soueraintie.
I haue a Daughter, but I hope of mettle,
Subiect to better temperature: should my Lucrece,
Be of this pride, thefe handes should sacrifice
Her blood vnto the Gods that dwell belowe,
The abortiue brat should not out liue my spleene,
But Lucrece is my Daughter, this my Queene.
Teare off the crowne, that yet empales the Temples
Of our vsurping Father: quickly Lords,
And in the face of his yet bleeding woundes,
Lets vs receiue our honours.
The same breath
Giues our state life, that was the Vsurpers death.
Heere then by heauens hand we inuest our selues:
Musique, whose loftiest tunes grace Princes crownde,
Vnto our Noble coronation sound.
Whome doth Valerius to our state present?
Two valiant Romans, this Horatius Cocles,
This Gent.
cal'd Mutius Sceuola,
Who whilst King Seruius wore the Diadem,
Vp held his sway and Prince-dome by their loues:
But he being falne, since all the Peeres of Rome
Applaud King Tarquin in his soueraintie,
They with like suffrage greet your coronation.
This hand alyde vnto the Roman Crowne,
Whome neuer feare deiected or cast low,
Laies his victorious sword at Tarquins feete,
And prostrates with his sword, allegiance.
King Seruius life we lou'd, but he expirde
Great Tarquins life, is in our hearts desirde.
Why?
whilst he rules with Iustice and integritie,
Shall with our dreadles hands, our hearts commaund,
Euen with the best imployment of our liues,
Since fortune lifts thee, we submit to fate,
Our selues are vassailes to the Roman state.
Your roomes were emptie in our traine of friendes,
Which we reioyce to see so wel supplyde:
Receiue our grace, liue in our clement fauours,
In whose submission our young glorie growes
To his ripe height: fall in our friendly traine,
And strengthen with your loues our Infant raigne.
We liue for Tarquin.
And to thee alone, whilst Iustice keepes thy Sword & thou thy Throane.
Then are you ours, and now conduct vs streight,
In triumph through the populous streetes of Rome,
To the Kings Pallace our maiesticke seate:
Your hearts though freely profferd we entreate.
What block is that we treade on?
Tis the body
Of your deceased Father Madam, Queene
Your shoe is crimsend with his vitall bloud.
No matter, let his mangled body lye,
and with his base confederates strewe the streets,
That in disgrace, of his vsurped pride,
We ore his truncke may in our Chariot ride:
For mounted like a Queene, twould doe me good
To wash my Coach-nailes in my fathers blood.
Heer's a good Childe.
Remoue it, we commaund, and beare his carkasse to the funerall pile
Where after this direction, let it haue
His solemne and due obsequies, faire Tullia,
Thy hate to him growes from thy loue to vs.
Thou shewst thy selfe in this vnnaturall strife,
an vnkinde Daughter, but alouing wife.
But on vnto our Pallace this blest day,
A Kings encrease, growes by a Kings decay.
Murder the King, a high and capitall treason.
Those Giants that wagde war against the Gods,
For which ore-whelmed Mountaines hurld by Ioue,
To scatter them, and giue timelesse Graues,
Was not more cruell then this butcherie.
This slaughter made by Tarquin, but the Queene,
A woman, fie, fie, did not this shee parracide
add to her fathers wounds: and when his body
Lay all besmeard and staind in the blood royall,
Did not this Monster, this infernate hagge
Make her vnwilling, Chariater driue on,
and with his shod wheeles crush her Fathers bones,
Breake his craz'd scull, and dash his braines
Vpon the pauements, whilst she hold the raines?
The affrighted Sunne, at this abhorred obiect,
Put on a maske of blood, and yet she blusht not,
Ioue art thou iust, hast thou reward for pietie?
and for offence no vengance?
or canst punnish
Fellons, and pardon Traitors, chastice murdrers,
and winke at parracides?
If thou be worthy
as well we know thou art, to fill the Throane
Of all eternitie, then with that hand
That flings the trisalitie thunder, let the pride
Of these our Irreligious monarkisers
Be crown'd in blood: this makes poore Brutus mad,
To see sin frolick, and the vertuous sad.
Soft, heeres Brutus, let vs acquaint him with the newes.
Content, now Cousen Brutus:
Who, I your kinsman?
though I be of the blood of the Tarquins, 
yet no cousen, gentle princes.
And why so Brutus, scorne you our allyance?
No, I was cousen to the Tarquins, when they were subiects, but dare claime no kindred, 
as they are soueraignes: Brutus is not so mad though he be merrie, 
but hee hath wit enough to keepe his head on his shoulders.
Why doe you my Lord thus loose your houres, and neither professe 
warre nor domestique profit?
the first might beget you loue, the other riches.
Because I would liue: haue I not answered you because I would liue?
fooles and Mad-men are no rubes in the way of Vsurpers: 
the firmament can brook but one Sunne, and for my part I must not shine: 
I had rather liue an obscure black, then appeare a faire white to be shot at, the end of all 
I would live: had Servius been a shrub, the winde had not shooke him, 
or a mad-man hee had not perisht: I couet no more wit nor imployment 
then as much as will keep life and soule together, I would but liue.
You are to satyricall cousen Brutus, but to the purpose: 
the King dreamt a strange ominous dreame last night, and to be resolu'd of the euent, 
my brother Sextus and I must to the Oracle.
And because we would bee well accompained, wee haue got leaue of the 
King that you Brutus shall associate vs, for our purpose is to make a merrie iourney on't.
So youle carrie me along with you to be your foole, & make you merrie.
Not our foole, but—
To make you merrie: I shall, nay, I will make you merrie, or tickle you till you laugh: 
the Oracle; ile goe to bee resolu'd some doubts priuate to my selfe: nay Princes, 
I am so much endeerd both to your loues and companies, 
that you shall not haue the power to be ridde of mee, what limits haue we for our iourney?
Fiue daies: no more.
I shal fit me to your preperation, but one thing more, goes Colatine along?
Collatine is troubled with the common disease of all new married men, hee's sick of the wife, 
his excuse is forsooth that Lucrece wil not let him goe, but you hauing 
neither wife nor wit to hould you, I hope will not disapoint vs.
Had I both, you should preuaile with me aboue another.
We shall expect you.
Horatius Cocles, a and Mutius Sceuola are not engadge in this expedition,
No they attend the King, farwell.
Lucretius stayes at home to, and Valerius.
The Pallace cannot spare them,
None but we three?
We three.
We three, well fiue dayes hence.
You haue the time, farwell.
The time I hope for, cannot be conscribde,
Within so short a limit, Rome and I
Are not so happy, what's the reason then
Heauen spares his rod so long?
Mercury tell me!
I havt'e: the fruite of pride is yet but greene,
Not mellow, though it grows apace, it comes not
To his ful height: Ioue oft delayes his vengeance,
That when it haps t'may prooue more terrible.
Dispaire not Brutus then but let thy country
And thee take this last comfort after all,
Pride when thy fruite is ripe must rot and fall.
But to the Oracle.
I would I were no Roman.
Cocles why?
I am discontented & dare not speake my thoughts.
What, shall I speake them for you?
Mutius doe.
Tarquin is proude.
Thou hast them.
Tiranous.
True.
Insufferable lofty.
Thou hast hit me.
And shall I tell thee what I prophesie
Or his succeeding rule?
No, lle dooe't for thee, Tarquins abilitie will in the weale,
Beget a weake vnable impotence:
His strength, make Rome and our dominions weake,
His soaring high make vs to flag our winges,
And fly close by the earth, his golden feathers,
Are of such Vastnes that they spread like sailes,
And so becalme vs that we haue not ayre,
Able to raise our plumes, to taste the pleasures of our owne Elements.
We are one harte, our thoughts & our desires are sutable.
Since he was King he beares him like a God,
His wife like Pallas or the wife of Joue,
Will not be parlied without sacrifice,
And homage sole due to the deities.
What hast with good Lucretius,
Hast small speede,
I had an earnest sute vnto the King,
About some busines that concernes the weale
Of Rome and vs, twi'll not be listned to,
He has took evppon him such ambiticus state,
That he abandons conference with his Piers,
Or if he chance to heare our tongus so much,
As but to heare their summons he despises,
The intent of all our speeches, our aduises,
And counsell: thinking his owne iudgement only,
To be aprooued in matters military,
And in affaires domesticke we are but shouts,
And fellowes of no partes, viols vnstrung,
Our notes to harsh to strike in princes eares,
Great Ioue amend it.
VVhither will you my Lord?
No matter where if frō the court, I'le home to Collatine,
And to my daughter Lucrece; home breedes safety,
Dangers begot in Court, a life retierd
Must please me now perforce: then noble Scevola,
And you my deere Horatius, farewell both,
VVhere industrie is scornd lets welcome sloth.
Nay good Lucretius, do not leaue vs thus,
See here comes Collatine, but wheres Valerius?
How does he taste these times?
Not giddily like Brutus, passionately
Like old Lucretius with his teare swoln eies, Not laughing like
Nor bluntly like Horatius Cocles here.
He has vsurpt a stranger garbe of humour,
Distinct from these in natures euery way.
How is he relisht, can his eies forbeare,
In this strange state to shed a passionate teare,
Can he forbeare to laugh with Sceuola,
At that which passionate weeping cannot mend.
Nay can his thought shape ought but melancholy
To see these dangerous passages of state,
How is he tempered noble Collatine?
Strangely, he is all song, hees ditty all,
Note that, Valerius hath giuen vp the Court
And weand himselfe from the kings consistory
In which his sweet harmonious tongue grew harsh,
VVhether it be that he is discontent
Yet would not so appeare before the king
Or whether in applause of these new Edicts,
VVhich so distast the people, or what cause,
I know not but now hee's all musicall.
Vnto the counsell chamber he goes singing,
And whilest the king his wilfull edicts makes,
In which nones tongue is powerfull saue the kings,
Hee's in a corner, relishing strange aires.
Conclusiuely he's frō a toward hopefull gentleman
Transeshapt to a meere balleter, none knowing
Whence should proceed this transitation.
See where he comes.
Morrow Valerius.
Morrow my Lord,
The first Song.
When Tarquin first in Court began,
And was approued King:
Some men for sodden ioy gan weepe,
And I for sorrow sing.
Ha, ha, how long has my Valerius
Put on his straine of mirth, or whats the cause?
The second Song.
Let humor change and spare not,
Since Tarquins proud I care not:
His faire words so bewitch my delight,
That I dote on his sight.
Now all is gone, new desires embraceing,
And my deserts disgracing.
Vpon my life he's either mad or loue-sicke,
Oh can Valerius, but so late a states-man,
Of whom the publique weale deseru'd so well
Tune out his age in songs and Cansonets,
Whose voyce should thunder conusell in the eares
Of Tarquin, and proud Tullia?
thinke Valerius
What that proud woman Tullia is, twill put thee
Quite out of tune.
The third Song.
Now what is loue I pray thee tell,
It is the fountaine and the well,
Where pleasure and repentance dwell,
It is perhaps the sansing bell,
That rings all in to heauen or hell:
And this is loue, and this is loue, as I heare tell.
Now what is loue I pray you shew,
A thing that creepes and cannot goe:
A prise that passeth to and fro,
A thing for me, a thing, for moe,
And he that proues shall find it so,
And this is loue, and this loue, sweet friends I tro.
Valerius I shall quickly change thy cheere,
And make thy passionate eyes lament with mine,
Thinke how that worthy Prince our kinsman King
Was butchered in the marble capitoll.
Shall Seruius Tullius vnregarded die
Alone of thee, whome all the Romaine Ladies,
Euen yet with teare-swolne eyes, and sorrowful soules
Compassionate, as well he merited;
To these lamenting dames what canst thou sing?
Whose greefe through all the Romaine Temples ring.
The fourth Song.
Lament Ladies lament
Lament the Roman land,
The King is fra thee hent,
Was doughtie on his hand,
Weele gang into the Kirke,
His dead corpes wele embrase,
And when we see him dead
We ay will cry alasse.
Fala la lero la
Tararara roun tarre &c.
This musick mads me, I all mirth dispise.
To heare him sing drawes riuers from his eyes.
It pleaseth me, for since the Court is harsh,
And lookes a skaunce on souldiers, lets be merry,
Court Ladies, sing, drinke, dance, and euery man
Get him a mistris, coach it in the Country,
And tast the sweets of it, what thinks Valerius,
Of Sceuolous last councell?
The fift Song.
Why since we souldiers cannot proue,
And greefe it is to vs therefore,
Let euery man get him a loue,
To trim her vp, and fight no more.
That we may tast of louers blisse,
Be merry and blith, imbrace and kisse,
That Ladies may say, some more of this,
That Ladies may say, some more of this.
Since Court and Country both grow proud,
And safety you delight to heare,
Wee in the Country will vs shroud,
VVhere liues to please both eye and eare
The Nightingale sings Iug, Iug, Iug,
The little Lambe leaps after his dug,
And the prety milke-maids they looke so smug,
And the prety milke-maids, &c.
Come Sceuola, shall we goe and be idle?
Ile in to weep.
But I my gall to grate.
Ile laugh at time, till it will change our Fate.
Thou art not what thou seem'st, Lord Sceuola,
Thy heart mournes in thee, though thy visage smile,
And so doe's thy soule weep, Valerius,
Although thy habit sing, for these new humors
Are but put on for safety, and to arme them
Against the pride of Tarquin, from whose danger,
None great in loue, in counsell or opinion
Can be kept safe: this makes me lose my houres
At home with Lucrece, and abandon court.
Fortune I embrace thee, that thou hast assisted me in finding my master, 
the Gods of good Rome keepe my Lord and master out of all bad company.
Sirra the newes with you.
Would you ha Court newes, Campe newes, City newes or Country newes, 
or would you know whats the newes at home?
Let me know all the newes.
The newes at Court is, that a small legge and a silke stocking are in fashion for your Lord: 
And the water that god Mercury makes is in request with your Ladie.
The heauinesse of the kings wine makes many a light head, 
and the emptines of his dishes manie full bellies, eating & drinking was neuer more  in vse; 
you shall find the baddest legs in bootes, and the worst faces in maskes.
They keep their old stomakes still, the kings good Cook hath the most wrong: 
for that which was wont to be priuate only to him, is now vsurpt among all the other officers: 
for now euery man in his place, to the preiudice of the master Cooke, 
makes bold to licke his owne fingers.
The newes in the Campe.
The greatest newes in the camp is, that there is no newes at all, 
for being no camp at all, how can there be any tidings from it?
Then for the Campe.
The Senators are rich, their wiues faire, credit growes cheap and trafficke deare, 
for you have many that are broke, the poorest man that is, may take vp what he will, 
so he will be but bound to a post, till he pay the debt: There was one Courtier, 
lay with twelue mens wiues in the suburbs, and pressing furder 
to make one more cuckold within the walles, and being taken with the maner, 
had nothing to say for himselfe, but this, he that made twelue made thirteene.
Now Sir for the Country.
There is no newes there but at the Ale-house, ther's the most receit, 
and is it not strange my Lord, that so many men loue ale that know not what ale is.
Why, what is ale?
Why ale is a kind of iuice, made of the pretious grain called Malt: & what is Malt?
Malt's MALT.
and what is MALT M much, A ale, L little, T thrift, all is, much ale's, little thrist.
Onely the newes at home, and I haue done.
My lady must needes speake with you about earnest busines, 
that concernes her neerly, and I was sent in all hast to entreat your Lordship to come away.
And couldest thou not haue told me?
Lucrece stay,
And I stand trifling here?
Fellow, away.
I Mary sir, the way into her were a way worth following,
and thats the reason that so many seruing-men that are familiar with their mistresses, 
haue lost the name of Seruitors, and are now called their Maisters followers.
Rest you merry.
O thou sacred God, enspire
The Priests, and with celestiall fire
Shot from thy beames, crowne our desire,
That we may follow.
In these thy true and hallowde measures,
The vtmost of thy heauenly treasures
According to the thoughts and pleasures
Of great Apollo.
Our hearts with inflammations burne
Great Tarquin and his people mourne
Till from thy Temple we returne
With some glad tidings.
Then tell vs, shall great Rome be blest
And roiall Tarquin liue in rest,
That giues his high Ennobled brest
To thy safe guiding?
Then Rome her ancient honours wins
When she is purgd from Tullius sins.
Gramercies Phoebus for these spelles,
Phoebus alone, alone excelles.
Tullia perhaps sinned in our gransiers death
And hath not yet by reconcilement made
Attone with Phoebus, at whose shrine we kneele.
Yet gentle Priest let vs thus farre preuaile,
To know if Tarquins seed shall gouerne Rome
And by succession claime the Royall wreath.
Behold me yonger of the Tarquins Race
This elder Aruns both the sons of Tullia.
This Iunius Brutus though a mad-man yet,
Of the high bloud of Tarquins.
Sextus peace.
Tell vs O thou that shin'st so bright
From whom the world receiues his light,
VVhose absence is perpetuall night,
whose praises ring.
Is it with heauens applause decreed,
VVhen Tarquins soule from earth is freed
That noble Sextus shall succeed
In Rome as king.
I Oracle hast thou lost thy tongue?
Tempt him againe faire Priest,
If not as king, let Delphian Phoebus yet
Thus much resolue me who shall gouerne Rome,
Or of vs three, beare greatest preheminence.
Sextus I will, yet sacred Phoebus we entreat,
VVhich of these three shall be great
Which largest power and state repleat
by the heauens doome
Phoebus thy thoughts no longer smother.
He that first shall kisse his mother
Shall be powerfull and no other
Of you three in Rome.
Shall kisse his mother.
Mother earth to thee an humble kisse I tender.
VVhat meanes Brutus?
The bloud of the slaughtred sacrifice made this flore as slippry 
as the place where Tarquin treades, tis glassy and as smoth as yce: 
I was proud to heare the Oracle so gracious to the bloud of the Tarquins and so I fell.
Nothing but so, then to the Oracle.
I charge thee Aruns, Iunus Brutus thee,
To keep the sacred doome of the Oracle
From all our traine, lest when the yonger lad
Our brother now at home, sits dandled
Vpon faire Tulliaes lap, this vnderstanding
May kisse our beauteous Mother and succeed.
Let the charge go round,
It shall go hard but Ile preuent you Sextus.
I feare not the madman Brutus, & for Aruns let me alone to buckle with him, 
I'le bee the first at my mothers lips for a kingdome.
If the mad-man had not beene before you Sextus, if Oracles be Oracles, 
their phrases are mysticall, they speake still in cloudes: had he meant 
a naturall mother he would ha spoke it by circumference.
Tullia, if euer thy lips were pleasing to me, let it be at my returne from the Oracle.
If a kisse will make me a king, Tullia I will spring to thee, though through the bloud of Sextus.
Earth I acknowledge no mother but thee, accept me as thy sonne, 
and I shall shine as bright in Rome as Apollo himselfe in his temple at Delphos.
Our superstitions ended, sacred Priest,
Since we haue had free answer from the Gods,
To whose faire altars we ha done due right
And hallowed them with presents acceptable,
Lets now returne, treading these holy measures,
VVith which we entred great Apolloes temple.
Now Phoebus let thy sweet tun'd organs sound,
VVhose spherelike musicke must direct our feet
Vpon the marble pauement: after this
VVeele gaine a kingdome by a mothers kisse.
Attend vs with your persons, but your eares
Be deafe vnto our counsels.
The Lords fall off on either side and attend.
Further yet.
Now Tuilia what must be concluded next?
The kingdome you haue got by policy
You must maintaine by pride.
Good Tullia.
Those that were late of the Kings faction
Cut off for feare they proue rebellious.
Better.
Since you gaine nothing by the popular loue,
Mainetaine by feare your princedome.
Excellent, thou art our Oracle, and saue from thee
VVe will admit no counsell, we obtaind
Our state by cunning, t'must be kept by strength.
And such as cannot loue, weele teach to feare,
To encourage which vpon a better iudgement,
And to strike greater terror to the world,
I have forbid thy fathers funerall.
No matter.
All capitall causes are by vs discust,
Trauerst and executed without counsell.
We challenge too by our prerogatiue,
The goods of such as striue against our state,
The freest citizens without attaint,
Arraigne or iudgment we to exile doome,
The poorer are our drudges, rich our pray,
And such as dare not striue our rule obey.
Kings are as Gods, and diuine scepters beare,
The Gods command for mortall tribute feare.
But royall Lord, we that despise thir loue,
Must seeke some meanes how to maintaine this awe
By forrenie leagues & by our strength abroad,
Shall we that are degreed aboue our people,
Whom heauen hath made our vassals reigne with them?
No, kings aboue the rest tribunald hie
Should with no meaner, then with kings ally:
For this we to Mamilius Tusculan
The Latine King ha giuen in mariage
Our royall daughter: now his peoples ours,
The neighbour princes are subdude by armes:
And whom we could not conquer by constraint
Them ha we sought to winne by courtesie,
Kings that are proud, yet would secure their owne,
By loue abroad, shall purchase feare at home.
We are secure, then yet our greatest strength
Is in our children: how dare treason looke
Vs in the face, hauing issue?
barren princes
Breed danger in their singularity
Hauing none to succeed, their clame dies with them:
But when in topping on three Tarquins more,
Like Hydraes heads grow to reuenge his death,
It terrifies blacke treason.
Tullia's wise, and apprehensiue, were our princely sons
Sextus and Aruns back returned safe,
With an applausiue answer of the Gods,
From th'oracle, our state were able then,
Being Gods our selues, to scorne the hate of men.
Wher's Tullia?
Where's our mother?
Yonder princes at Counsell with the king.
Our sons return'd.
Roiall mother.
Renowned Queene.
I loue her best, therefore will Sextus do his duty first.
Being eldest in my birth i'le not be yongest In zeale to Tullia.
Too't lads.
Mother a kisse.
Though last in birth, let me be first in loue.
A kisse faire mother.
Shall I lose my right?
Aruns Shal downe were Aruns twice my brother
If he presume fore me to kisse my mother.
I Sextus, thinke this kisse to be a crowne, thus wold we tug fort.
Aruns thou must downe.
Restraine them Lords.
Nay to't boies, ô tis braue, they tug for shadowes, I the substance haue.
Through armed gates, and thousand swords il'e breake
To shew my duty, let my valour speake.
Oh heauens ye haue dissolu'd me.
Here I stand, what I ha done to answer with this hand.
Oh all you Delphian Gods looke downe and see,
How for these wrongs I will reuenged be.
Curb in the proud boyes fury: let vs know
From whence this discord riseth.
From our loue, how happy are we in our issue now,
When as our sons, euen with their blouds contend,
To exceed in duty we accept your zeale,
This your superlatiue degree of kindnes
So much preuailes with vs, that to the king
We engage our owne deere loue twixt his incensement,
And your presumption, you are pardond both.
And Sextus though you faild in your first proffer,
We do not yet esteeme you least in loue, ascend & touch our lips
Thanke you, no.
Then to thy knee we will descend thus low
Nay now it shall not need: how great's my heart!
In Tarquins crowne thou hast now lost thy part.
No kissing now, Tarquin, great Queene adiew:
Aruns On earth we ha no foe but you.
What meanes this their vnnaturall emnity?
hate borne from loue.
Resolue vs then, how did the Gods accept
Our sacrifice, how are they pleasd with vs.
How long will they applaud our soueraignty?
Shall I tell the king.
Do Cosen, with the processe of your iorny.
I will.
We went from hither, when we went from hence, 
arriued thither when we landed there, made an end of our 
praiers when we had done our Orisons, when thus quoth Phoebus,
Tarquin shall be happy whilest he is blest, gouerne while he raignes, 
wake when he sleeps not, sleepe when he wakes not, quaffe when he drinkes, 
eate when he feedes, gape when his mouth opens, liue till he die, 
and die when he can liue no longer.
So Phoebus commends him to you.
Mad Brutus still, Son Aruns What say you.
That the great Gods to whom the potent king
Of this large Empire, sacrific'd by vs,
Applaud your raigne, commend your soueraignty:
And by a generall Synode grant to Tarquin,
Long daies, faire hopes, Maiestique gouernment.
Adding withall, that to depose the late king, which in
others, had bin arch treason, in Tarquin was honour: what in
Brutus had beene vsurpation, in Tarquin was lawful succession
and for Tullia, though it be parricide for a child to kil her father,
in Tullia it was charitie by death.
To rid him of all his calamities, Phoebus himselfe, said she, was a good child, 
and shall not I say as he saies, to tread vpon her fathers skull, 
sparkle his braines vpon her chariot wheele,
And weare the sacred tincture of his bloud
Vpon the seruile shoe?
but more then this,
After his death deny him the due claime
Of all mortality, a funerall,
An earthen sepulcher: this this, quoth the Oracle,
Saue Tullia none would doe.
Brutus no more, lest with our surpast eies of wrath & fury
We looke into the humour; were not madnes
And folly to thy words a priuilege
Euen in thy last reproofe of our proceedings
Thou hadst pronounc't thy death.
If Tullia will send Brutus abroad for newes, and after at his returne not endure the telling of it; 
let Tullia either get closer eares, or get for Brutus a stricter tongue.
God boye.
Alas tis madnes, pardon him, not spleene,
Nor is it hate, but frensie, we are pleasde
To heare the Gods propitious at our prayers.
But withers Sextus gone?
resolue vs Cocles,
We saw thee in his parting follow him.
I heard him say, he would straight take his horse
Vnto the warlike Gabines enemies.
To Rome and you, saue them we haue no opposites.
And dares the boy, confederate with our foes?
Attend vs Lords, we must new battels wage,
And with bright armes confront the proud boyes rage.
Had I as many soules as drops of bloud
In this brancht vaines, as many liues as starres
Stucke in yond azare roofe, and were to dy
More deathes then I see wasted weary minuts,
To grow to this, Ide hazard all, and more,
To purchase freedome to this bondag'd Rome.
I'me vext to see this virgin conqueresse weare shackles in my fight.
Oh would my teares would rid great Rome of these prodigious feares.
What weeping ripe Lucretius?
Possible?
now Lords, Ladies, friends, fellows, 
yong madcap, gallāts & old courtly ruffins, al subiects vnder one tirāny, 
& therfore shold be partners of one & the same vnanimity.
Shall we go single our 
selues by two & two, & go talke treason?
then tis but his yea, and my nay, 
if we be cal'd to question: Or shals go vse some violent bustling to breake
through this thorny seruitude, or shall we euery man go sit like a man in desperation, 
and with Lucretius weep at Romes misery: now am I for all things, any thing or nothing, 
I can laugh with Sceuola, weep with this good old man, sing oh onhe hone 
with Valerius, fret with Horatius Cocles, be mad like my selfe, neutrize with Collatine.
Say what shal's do?
fret.
Sing.
Weepe.
Laugh.
Rather lets all be mad that Tarquin stil raigneth, Romes still sad.
You are madmen all that yeeld so much to passion.
You lay your selues too open to your enemies,
That would be glad to prie into your deedes,
And catch aduantage to ensnare our liues.
The kings feare like a shadow dogs you still,
Nor can you walke without it: I commend
Valerius most, and noble Sceuola
That what they cannot mend, seeme not to mind,
By my consent lets all weare out our houres
In harmles sports, hauke, hunt, game, sing, drinke, daunce,
So shall we seeme offenseles & liue safe.
In dangers bloudy iawes where being humerous, 
Cloudy and curiously inquisitiue.
Into the kings proceedings there armde feare
May search into vs, call our deedes to question,
And so preuent all future expectation:
Of wisht amendment let vs stay the time,
Till heauen haue made them ripe for iust reuenge,
When opportunitie is offred vs.
And then strike home, till then do what you please:
No discontented thought my mind shall cease.
I am of Collatines minde.
Now Valerius sing vs a baudy song.
and makes merry, nay it shall be so.
Brutus shall pardon me.
The time that should haue been seriously spent in the State house, 
I ha learnt securely to spend in a wenching house, 
and now I professe my selfe any thing but a States-man.
the more thy vanity.
The lesse thy honour.
The more his safety, and the lesse his feare.
We ha beene mad Lords long, now let vs be merry Lords, Horatins maugree thy 
melancholy, and Lucretius in spight of thy sorrow, Ile haue a song a subiect for the ditty.
Great Tarquins pride, and Tulliaes cruelty.
Dangerous, no.
The tyrannies of the Court, & the vassalage of the City.
Neither shall I giue the subiect.
Do, & let it be of all the prety wenches in the Suburbs of Rome.
It shall, it shall, shall it Valerius?
Any thing, according to my poore acquaintance, & little conuersance.
Nay you shall stay Horatius, Lucretius so shall you, he remoues himselfe 
from the loue of Brutus, that shrinkes from my side till 
we haue had a song of all the prety suburbians: sit round, when Valerius?
Shall I woe the louely Molly,
Shee's so faire, so fat, so iolly,
But she has a tricke of folly,
Therefore I'll ha none of Molly.
No no no, no no no.
Ile haue none of Molly no no no.
Oh the cherry lips of Nelly,
They are red and soft as ielly,
But too well she loues her belly,
therfore ile haue none of Nelly.
No no &c.
What say you to bonny Betty,
Ha you seene a lasse to pretty?
But her body is so swetty,
Therefore ile ha none of Bety.
No no no, &c.
When I dolly with my Dolly,
She is full of melancholly
Oh that wench is pestilent holy,
Therefore ile haue none of Dolly.
No no no, &c.
I could fancie louely Nanny,
But she has the loues of many,
Yet her selfe she loues not any,
Therefore ile haue none of Nanny, No no no, &c.
In a flax-shop I spide Ratchel,
Where she her flax and tow did hachel,
But her cheekes hang like a satchell.
Therefore ile ha none of Ratchel.
No no no, &c.
In a corner I met Biddy,
Her heeles were light her head was giddy,
She fell downe and somewhat did I,
Therefore ile haue none of Biddy.
No no no, &c.
The rest weele heare within: what offence is there in this Lucretius, 
what hurt's in this Horatius?
Is it not better to sing with our heads on 
then weepe with our heads off, I nere tooke Collatine for a polititian till now.
Come Valerius, weele run ouer all the wenches of Rome, 
euen from the community of lasciuious Flora to the chastity 
of diuine Lucrece, come good Horat.
A Chaire.
A chaire for my Lady, Mrs. Mirable do you not heare my Mrs call.
Come neere sir, be lesse officious.
In duty, and vse more attention,
Nay gentlewoman we exempt not you
From our discourse, but you must afford an eare
As well as he, to what we ha to say.
I still remaine your handmaid.
Sirra I ha seene you oft familiar
With this my Maid and waiting gentlewoman.
As casting amorous glances, wanton lookes,
And pretty beckes, sauouring incontinence.
I let you know you are not for my seruice
Vnlesse you grow more ciuill.
Indeed madam for my owne part I wish MrsMirable wel as one fellow 
seruāt ought to wish to another, but to say that euer 
I flung any sheepes eies in her face, how say you mistresse Mirable did I euer offer it?
Nay mistres I ha seene you answere him
With gracious lookes and some vnciuill smiles,
Retorting eies, and giuing his demeanure
Such welcome as becomes not modesty.
Know henceforth there shall no lasciuious phrase,
Suspitious looke or shadow of incontinence
Be entertaind by any that attend on Romane Lucrece.
Madam I.
Excuse it not, for my premeditable thought
Speakes nothing out of rashnes, nor vaine hearesay.
But what my owne experience testifies:
Against you both let then this mild reproofe
Forewarne you of the like, my reputation
Which is held pretious in the eies of Rome,
Shall be no shelter to the least intent
Of loosenes, leaue all familiarity:
And quite renounce acquaintance, or I here discharge you both my seruice.
For my owne part madam, as I am a true Romane by nature, though no Romane by my nose, 
I neuer spent the least lip labour on mistris Mirable neuer so much as glaunc'd, 
neuer vs'd any winking or pinking, neuer nodded at her, no not so much as 
when I was asleep neuer askt her the questiō so much as whats her name, 
if you can bring any man womā or child, that can say so much behind my backe; 
As for he did but kisse her, for he did but kisse her and so let her go, let my Lord Callatine 
in stead of plucking my coat, pluck my skin ouer my eares & turne me away naked, 
that wheresoeuer I shall come I may be held a raw seruingman hereafter.
Sirra you know our minde.
If euer I knew what bolongs to these cases, or yet know what they meane, 
if euer I vsed any plaine dealing, or were euer worth such a iewell, would I might die a begger, 
if euer I were so far read in my grammar, as to know what an Interiection is, 
or a coniunction copulatiue, would I might neuer haue good of my qui qua quod:
why do you thinke madam, I haue no more care of my selfe being but a stripling, then 
to go to it at these yeares?
flesh and bloud cannot endure it, I shall euen spoile  
one of the best faces in Rome with crying at your vnkindnes.
I ha done, see if you can spy your Lord rerurning from the Court, and giue me 
notice what strangers he brings home with him.
Yes Ile go, but see kind man he saues me a labour.
Faire Lucrece, I ha brought these Lords from Court
To feast with thee, sirra prepare vs dinner.
My Lord is welcom, so are all his friends, the newes at Court Lords?
Madam strange newes: Prince Sextus by the enemies of Rome
Was nobly vsde and made their Generall,
Twice hath he met his father in the field,
And foild him by the warlick Gabines aid:
But how hath he rewarded that braue Nation,
That in his great disgrace supported him?
Ile tell you Madam, he since the last battell
Sent to his father a close messenger
To be receiu'd to grace, withall demanding
What he should doe with those his enemies:
Great Tarquin from his son receiues this newes,
Being walking in his Garden, when the messenger
Importunde him for answere, the proud king
Lops with his wand the heads of poppies off,
And saies no more, with this vncertain answere
The messenger to Sextus back returnes.
who questions of his fathers words, lookes, gesture,
He tels him what the hawty speechles King
Did to the heads of poppies, which bold Sextus
Straight apprehends, cuts off the great mens heads,
And hauing left the Gabines without Gouernors,
Flies to his father, and this day is welcom'd
For this his trayterous seruice, by the King
With all due solemne honours to the Court.
Curtefie strangely requited, this none but the sonne of Tarquin would euer haue enterpris'de.
I like it, I applaud it, this will come to somwhat in the end, when heauen 
has cast vp his account, some of them will be cald to a hard reckoning.
Leaue all to heauen.
My Lords, the best plum poredge in all Rome cooles for your honors,
dinner is piping hot vpō the table: & if you make not the more hast, you are like 
to haue but cold cheare, the cook hath done his part, & ther's not a dish vpō the dresser 
but he has made smoake for you, if you haue good stomackes, and come not 
in while the meat is hot, you'le make hunger and cold meet together.
My man's a Rhetorician I can tell you,
And this conceit is fluent.
Enter Lords,
You must be Lucrece guests, and she is scant
In nothing: for such princes must not want.
My Lord Valerius, I haue euen a suit to your honour, I ha not the power to part from you, without a relish, a note, a tone, we must get an aire betwixt vs.
Thy meaning.
Nothing but this, Iohn for the king, has bin in many ballads, Iohn for the king downe 
dino, Iohn for the king, has eaten many sallats Iohn for the king sings hey ho.
Thou wouldst haue a song, wouldst thou not?
And be euerlastingly bound to your honour, I am now forsaking the world and the Diuill, 
and somewhat leaning towards the flesh, if you could but teach me how to choose a wench
fit for my stature and complection, I should rest yours in all good offices.
Ile do that for thee, what's thy name?
My name sir is Pompie.
Well then attend,
The seuenth song.
Pompie I will shew thee the waie to know
A daintie dapper wench
First see her all bare, let her skin be rare,
And be toucht with no part of the french:
Let her eye be cleare, and her brow seuere,
Her eie-browes thin and fine:
But if she be a punke, and loue to be drunke,
Then keep her still from the wine.
Let her stature be mean, & her body cleane
Thou canst not choose but like her.
But see she ha good clothes, with a faire Romane nose,
For thats the signe of a striker.
Let her legs be small, but not vs'd to sprall,
Her tongue not too lowd nor cocket,
Let her armes be strong and her fingers long.
But not vs'd to diue in a pocket.
Let her body be long and her backe be strong,
With a soft lip that entangles,
With an iuory brest, and her haire well dresst
Without goldlace or spangles.
Let her foot be small, cleane legd withall,
Her apparell not too gaudy:
And one that hath not bin, in no house of sin,
Nor place that hath beene bawdy.
But gods me, I am trifling heere with thee, & dinner cooles o'th table, & I am cald to my attendance, oh my sweet Lord Valerius.
Next king Porsenna, whom we tender deerely,
Welcome yong Sextus, thou hast to our yoake,
Supprest the necke of a proud nation
The warlike Gauines, enemies to Rome.
It was my duty royall Emperour,
The duty of a subiect and a son.
We at our mothers intercession likewise,
Are now aton'd with Aruns, whō we here receiue into our bosom
This is done like a kind brother and a naturall son.
VVe enterchange a royall heart with Sextus & graft vs in your loue.
Now king Porsenna, welcome once more, to Tarquin and to Rome.
VVe are proud of your aliance, and Rome is ours,
And we are Romes, this our religious league,
Shall be caru'd firme in characters of brasse,
And liue for euer to succeeding times.
It shall Porsenna, now this leagues establisht,
We will proceede in our determinde warres
To bring the neighbor Nations vnder vs.
Our purpose is to make young Sextus Generall
Of all our army, who hath prou'd his fortunes
And found them full of fauour, weele begin
With strong Ardea, ha you giuen in charge
To assemble all our Captaines, & take muster of our strōg army?
That busines is dispatcht.
Wee ha likewise sent for all our best commanders to take charge
According to their merit, Lord Valerius,
Lord Brutus, Cocles, Mutius, Sceuola,
And Collatine to make due preparation of such a gallant siege.
This day you shall set forward, Sextus go,
And let vs see your army march along
Before this King and vs, that we may view
The puissance of our host prepar'd already,
To lay high-reard Ardea waste and lowe.
I shall my liege.
Aruns associate him.
A riuall with my brother in his honors.
Porsenna shall behold the strength of Rome,
And bodie of the Camp vnder the charge
Of two braue Princes to lay hostile siege
Against the strongest citie that withstands
The all commanding Tarquin.
Tis an obiect, to please Porsennaes Eie.
The host is now vpon his march,
You from this place may see,
The pride of all the Roman chiualry.
This sight's more pleasing to Porsennaes eye,
Then all our rich Attalia pompous feasts,
Or sumptuous Reuels: we are borne a soldier:
And in our nunnage suckt the milke of warre.
Should any strange fate lowre vpon this army,
Or that the merciles gulfe of confusion
Should swallow them, we at our proper charge,
And from our natiue confines vow supply
Of men and Armes to make these numbers full.
You are our Royall brother, and in you
Tarquin is powerfull and maintaines his awe.
The like Porsenna may command of Rome.
But we haue in your fresh varieties
Feasted too much, and kept our selfe too long
From our stone seate, our prosperous returne
Hath bin expected by our Lords and Pieres.
The busines of our warres thus forwarded,
We ha best leisure for our entertainment,
Which now shall want no due solemnitie.
It hath bin beyond both expectation
And merit, but in sight of heauen I sweare
If euer royall Tarquin shall demand
Vse of our loue, tis ready stor'de for you,
Euen in our Kingly breast.
The like we vow, to King Porsenna, we wil yet a little
Enlarge your royall welcome with Rarieties,
Such as Rome yeelds: that done before we part
Of two remote dominions make one heart.
Set forwards then, our sons wage warre abroad,
To make vs peace at home, we are of our selfe
Without supportance, we all fate defy,
Aidlesse, and of our selfe we stand thus hy.
Stand, who goes there?
A friend.
Stir not, for if thou dost Ile broch thee straight vpon the pike, The word.
Porsenna.
Passe, stay, who walkes the round to night,
The Generall, or any of his Captaines?
Horatius hath the charge, the other Chieftens
Rest in the Generals tent, theres no commander
Of any note but reuell with the Prince:
And I among the rest am chargd to attend
Vpon their Rouse.
Passe freely, I this night must stand,
Twixt them and danger, the time of night.
The clocke last told eleuen.
The powers celestiall, that ha tooke Rome in charge protect it still.
Againe good night, thus must poore Souldiers do,
Whilest their commanders are with dainties fed,
They sleep on Downe, the earth must be our bed.
Sit round, the enemy is pounded fast
In their owne folds, the wals made to oppugne,
Hostile incursions become a prison
To keep them fast for excution;
Ther's no eruption to be feard.
What shals do?
come a health to the Generals health, & Valerius 
that sits the most ciuilly shall begin it, I cannot talke till my bloud be mingled 
with this bloud of grapes: Fill, for Valerius thou shouldst drinke well, 
for thou hast been in the German warres, if thou loust me, drinke vpse freeze.
Nay, since Brutus has spoke the word, the first health shal be impos'd on 
you Valerius, and if euer you haue bin germanised, let it be after the Dutch fashion.
The Generall may command.
He may, why else is he cald the Commander?
We will intreat Valerius.
Since you wil needes enforce a hie-German health, looke well to your heads, 
for I come vpon you with this dutch Tassaker, if you were of a more noble science then you are,
it will go neere to breake your heads round.
O Morke gyff men ein man,
Skerry merry vip,
O morke gyff men ein man
Skerry merry vap.
O morke gyff men ein man,
that tik die scine long o drieuan can;
Skerry merry vip, and skerry merry vap,
and skerry merry runke ede bunk,
Ede hoore was a haie dedle downe
Deale drunke a:
Skerry merry runk, ede bunk, ede hoor was drunk a
O daughter yeis ein alto kleene
Skerry merry vip,
O daughter yeis ein alto kleene,
Skerry merry vap,
O daughter yeis ein alto kleene,
Ye molten slop, ein yere a leene
Skerry merry vip, and skerry merry vap
And skerry merry runk ede bunk
Ede hoore was a bay dedle downe
Dedle drunk a:
Skerry merry, runk ede bunke ede hoor was drunk a.
Gramercies Valerius, came this hie-German health 
as double as his double double ruffe, i'de pledge it.
Were it in Lubeckes or double double beere their owne naturall liquor i'de pledge it, 
were it as deep as his ruffe, let the health go round about the board as 
his band goes round about his necke, I am no more afraid of this dutch fauchiō, 
thē I should be of the heathenish inuention.
I must entreat you spare me, for my braine brookes not the fumes of wine, 
their vaporous strength offends me much.
I would haue none spare me, for ile spare none, Collatine 
will pledge no health vnlesse it be to his Lucrece.
What's Lucrece but a woman, and what are women
But tortures and disturbance vnto men.
If they be foule th'are odious, and if faire,
Th'are like rich vessels ful of poysnous drugs,
Or like black serpents arm'd with golden scales,
For my owne part, they shall not trouble me.
Sextus, sit fast, for I proclaime my selfe a womans chāpion, and shall vnhorse thee else.
For my owne part, Ime a marride man, and Ile speake to my wife to thanke thee Brutus.
I haue a wife too, and I thinke, the most vertuous Lady in the world.
I cannot say but that I haue a good wife too, & I loue her: but if she were in heauen, 
beshrew me if I would wish her so much hurt as to desire her cōpany vpon 
earth agin, yet vpō my honour, though she be not very faire, she is exceeding honest.
Nay the lesse beautie the lesse temptation to dispoile her honesty.
I should be angry with him that should make question of her honour.
And I angry with thee if thou shouldst not maintaine her honour.
If you compare the vertues of your wiues, let me step in for mine.
I should wrong my Lucrece not to stand for her.
Ha, ha, all captens, and stand vpon the honesty of your
wiues, ist possible thinke you, that women of young spirit and full age,
Of fluent wit, that can both sing and dance,
Reade, write, such as feede well and taste choice cates,
That straight dissolue to purity of blood,
That keep the veines full, and enflame the appetite,
Making the spirit able, strong and prone,
Can such as these their husbands being away
Emploid in forreine sieges or elsewhere,
Deny such as importune them at home?
Tell me that flax wil not be toucht with fire,
Nor they be won to what they most desire.
Shall I end this controuersie in a word?
Do good Brutus.
I hold some holy but some apt to sin,
Some tractable, but some that none can winne,
Such as are vertuous, Gold nor wealth can moue,
Some vicious of themselues are prone to loue.
Some Grapes are sweete and in the Gardens grow,
Others vnprunde, turne wild neglected so.
The purest oare containes both Gold and drosse,
The one all gaine, the other nought but losse.
The one disgrace, reproch and scandall taints,
The other angels and sweete featurde saints.
Such is my vertuous Lucrece.
Yet for her vertue, not comparable to the wife of Aruns.
And why may not mine be rāckt with the most vertuous?
I would put in for a lot, but 1000 to one I shall draw but a blancke.
I should not shew I lou'd my wife, not to take her part in her absence, I hold her inferior to none.
Saue mine.
No, not to her.
Oh this were a braue controuersie for a Iury of weomen to arbitrate.
Ile hazard all my fortunes on the vertues
Of diuine Lucrece, shall we try them thus?
It is now dead of night, lets mount our steeds,
Within this two houres we may reach to Rome,
And to our houses all come vnpreparde,
And vnexpected by our hy praisd wives,
She of them al that we finde best imploid,
Deuoted and most huswife exercised,
Let her be held most vertuous, and her husband
Win by the wager a good horse and armour.
A hand on that.
Heres a helping hand to that bargaine.
But Shal we to horse without circumstance?
Sceuola will be mounted with the first.
Then moūt, Cheuall Brutus, this night take you the charge of the army, 
Ile see the triall of this wager, 'twould do me good to see some of them 
find their wiues in the armes of their louers, they are so confident in their vertues, 
Brutus weele enterchange, good night within, be thou but as prouident ore the army as we 
(if our horses faile not) expeditious in our iorney, horse, horse, horse.
But one houre more & you shall all to rest,
Now that your Lord is absent from this house,
And that the Masters eie is from his charge,
We must be carefull and with prouidence
Guide his domestick busines, we ha now
Giuen ore all feasting and leaud reuelling,
Which ill becomes the house whose Lord is absent,
We banish all excesse til his returne,
In feare of whom my soule doth daily mourne.
Madam so please you to repose your selfe
Within your Chamber, leaue vs to our taskes,
We will not loiter though you take your rest.
Not so, you shall not ouerwatch your selues
Longer then I wake with you: for it fits
Good huswifes when their husbands are frō home,
To ey their seruants labors and in care,
And the true manage of his houshold state,
Earliest to rise, and to be vp most late.
Since all his busines he commits to me,
Ile be his faithfull steward til the camp
Dissolue and he returne, thus wiues should doe,
In absence of their Lords be husband too.
Madam the Lord Turnus his man was thrice for you here to haue entreated you home to supper, 
he saies his L. takes it vnkindly he could not haue your company.
To please a louing husband, Ile offend
The loue and patience of my dearest friend,
Me thinkes his purpose was vnreasonable
To draw me in my husbands absence forth
To feast and banquet, twould haue ill becomd me,
To ha left the charge of such a spacious house, without both L. & Mistres,
I am opiniond thus, wiues should not stray,
Out of their dores their husbāds being away: L. Turnus shal excuse me.
Pray Madam set me right into my worke,
Being abroad I may forget the charge.
Imposde me by my L. or be compeld
To stay out late, which were my husband here,
Might be without distast, but he from hence,
Which late abroad, there can no excuse dispence.
Here take your worke againe, a while proceede,
And then to bed, for whilst you sow, Ile read.
I would haue hazsarded all my hopes, my wife had not beene so late a reuelling.
Nor mine at this time of night a gamboling.
They weare so much corke vnder their heeles, they cannot choose but loue to caper.
Nothing does me good, but that if my wife were watching all theirs were wantoning, 
and if I ha lost, none can brag of their winnings.
Now Collatine to yours, either Lucrece must bee better imploid then the rest, 
or you content to haue her vertues ranckt with the rest.
I am pleasd.
Soft, soft, lets steale vpon her as vpon the rest, lest hauing some watchword at our ariual, 
we may giue her notice to be better prepar'd, nay by your leaue 
Collatine, weel limit you no aduātage.
See Lords, thus Lucrece reuels with her maids, In stead of Riot quaffing 
& the practise of hy lavolties to the rauishing sound of chambring musique, 
she like a good huswife Is teaching of her husband sundry chares.
Lucrece?
My L. & husband welcom, 10 times welcom.
Is it to see your Lucrece you thus late
Ha with your persons so hazard left the camp,
And trusted to the danger of a night so darke, and full of horror?
Lords all's lost.
By Ioue, Ile buy my wife a wheele and make her spin for this trick.
If I make not mine learne to liue by the prick of her needle for this, I'm no Roman.
Sweete wife salute these Lords, thy continence
Hath won thy husbād a Barbarian horse, & a rich cote of armes.
O pardon me, the ioy to see my Lord,
Tooke from me all respect of their degrees,
The richest entertainment liues with vs,
According to the houre and the prouision
Of a poore wife in the absence of her husband:
We prostrate to you howsoeuer meane,
We thus excusde, Lord Collatine away,
We neither feast, dance, quaffe, riot nor play.
If one woman among so many bad, may be found good, 
If a white wench may proue a black swan, it is Lucrece,  
her beauty hath relation to her vertue, and her vertue correspondence to her beautie, 
and in both she is fellowlesse.
Lords wil you yeeld the wager?
Stay, the wager was as well which of our wiues was fairest too, 
it stretcht aswell to their beautie as to their continence, who shall iudge that?
That can none of vs, because we are all parties, let Prince 
Sextus determin it who hath bin with vs, and bin an ey witnesse of their beauties.
Agreed.
I am pleasd with the censure of P. Sextus.
So are wee all.
I commit my Lucrece wholly to the censure of Sextus.
And Sextus commits him wholy to the dispose of Lucrece.
I loue the Lady and her grace desire,
Nor can my loue wrong what my thought admire.
Aruns, no question but your wife is chaste,
And thrifty, but this Lady knowes no wast.
Valerius, yours is modest something faire,
Her Grace and beautie are without compare,
Thine Mutius well dispos'd and of good feature,
But the world yeelds not so diuine a creature.
Horatius, thine a smug lasse and grac't well.
But amongst all bright Lucrece doth excel.
Then our impertiall harts and iudging eies,
This verdit gives, faire Lucrece wins the prise.
Then Lords you are indebted to me a horse and armour.
We yee'd it.
Wil you taste such welcom Lords, as a poore vnprouided house can yeeld?
Gramercie Lucrece, no, we must this night sleepe by Ardea walles.
I but my Lords, I hope my Collatine will not so leaue his Lucrece.
He must, we haue but idled from the Camp, to try a merry wager about their wiues, 
and tis the hazard of the kings displeasure, should any man be missing from his charge: 
the powers that gouern Rome make diuine Lucrece for euer happy, goodnight.
Will not my husband repose this night with vs?
Lucrece shall pardon him, we ha tooke our leaues of our wiues, 
nor shall Collatine be before vs, though our Ladies in other things come behind you.
I must be swaid: the ioies and the delights of many thousand nights meet 
all in one to make my Lucrece happy.
I am bound to your strict wil, to each goodnight.
To horse, to horse, Lucrece we cannot rest,
Til our hot lust imbosome in thy brest.
With no vnkindnes we should our Lords vpbraid,
Husbands and Kings must alwaies be obaid.
Nothing saue the high busines of the state,
And the charge giuen him at Ardeas siege,
Could ha made Collatine so much digresse
From the affection that he beares his wife.
But subiects must excuse when kings claime power.
But leauing this before the charme of sleepe,
Cease with his downy wings vpon my eies,
I must go take account among my seruants
Of their daies taske, we must not cherish sloth,
No couetous thought makes me thus prouident,
But to shun idlenes, which wise men say,
Begets ranck lust, and vertue beats away.
Returne to Rome, now we are in the mid way to the Cāp?
My Lords tis busines that concernes my life,
To morrow if we liue weele visit thee.
Wil Sextus enioyne me to accompany him?
Or me?
Nor you, nor any, tis important busines
And serious occurrences that call me,
Perhaps Lords Ile commend you to your wiues.
Colatine shall I doe you any seruice to your Lucrece?
Only commend me.
What, no priuat token to purchase our kind welcom?
Would Roiall Sextus would but honor me to beare her a slight token.
What?
This Ring.
As I am Royall I wil see't deliuered.
This Ring to Lucrece shall my loue conuey,
And in this gift thou dost thy bed betray.
To morrow we shall meete, this night sweet fate,
May I proue welcome though a guest ingrate.
Hees for the city, we for the campe, the night makes the way tedious and melancholy, 
prethee Valerius a merry song to beguile it.
There was a yong man and a maid fell in loue,
Terry dery ding, terry dery ding, tery tery dino.
To get her good will he often did,
Terry dery ding, terry dery ding, langtido dille.
Theres many will say, and most will alow, terry dery, &c.
Thers nothing so good as a terry dery dery dery, &c.
I would wish all maides before they be sicke, terrie derie, &c.
To enquire for a yong man that has a good terrie dery, &c.
Good Valerius, this has brought vs euen to the skirts of the campe, enter Lords.
This ring, my Lord, hath opt our gates to you,
For though I know you for a royall Prince,
My soueraignes sonne, and friend to Collatine:
Without that key you had not entred here.
More lights, and see a banquet strait prouided,
My loue to my deere husband shall appeare,
In the kind welcome that I giue his friend.
Not loue-sicke, but loue lunatike, loue-mad,
I am all fire, impatience, and my bloud
Boyles on my heart, with loose and sensuall thoughts.
A chaire for the Prince, may't please your highnes sit.
Madam, with you.
It will become the wife of Collatine to waite vpon your trencher.
You shall sit, behind vs at the campe we left our state,
We are but your guest, indeed you shall not waite,
Her modestie hath such strong power ore me,
And such a reuerence hath fate giuen her brow,
That it appeares a kind of blasphemy,
To haue any wanton word harsh in her eares,
I cannot woo, and yet I loue boue measure,
Tis force, not suite, must purchase this rich treasure.
Your highnesse cannot taste such homely cates.
Indeed I cannot feed, but on thy face,
Thou art the banquet that my thoughts embrace.
Knew you, my Lord, what free and zelous welcome
We tender you, your highnesse would presume
Vpon your entertainement; oft, and many times
I haue heard my husband speake of Sextus worth,
Extoll your worth, praise your perfection,
I, dote vpon your valor, and your friendship prise next his Lucrece.
Oh impious lust, in all things base, respectles & vniust,
Thy vertue, grace and fame I must enioy,
Though in the purchase I all Rome destroy.
Madame, if I be welcome, as your vertue bids me presume I am,
Carouse to me a health vnto your husband.
A womans draught my Lord, to Collatine.
Nay, you must drinke off all.
Your grace must pardon the tender weaknesse of a womans braine.
It is to Collatine.
Me thinks twould ill become the modesty
Of any Romane Lady to carouse,
And drowne her vertues in the iuice of grapes.
How can I shew my loue to my husband,
To do his wife such wrong, by too much wine
I might neglect the charge of this great house,
Left soly to my keepe, else my example
Might in my seruants breed encouragement
So to offend, both which were pardonlesse,
Else to your grace I might neglect my duty,
And slacke obeysance to so great a guest:
All which being accidentall vnto wine,
Oh let me not so wrong my Collatine.
We excuse you, her imperfections like a torrent
With violence breakes vpon me, and at once
Inuert and swallow all thats good in me.
Preposterous fates, what mischiefes you inuolue
Vpon a captiue Prince left to the fury
Of all grand mischiefe, hath the grandame world
Yet smothred such a strange abortiue wonder,
That from her vertues should arise my sinne:
I am worse then whats most ill, depriude all reason,
My hart all firie lust, my soule all treason.
My Lord, I feare your health, your changing brow
Hath shewne so much disturbance, noble Sextus,
Hath not your ventrous trauell from the campe,
Nor the moyst rawnes of these humorous night impairde your health?
Diuinest Lucrece no.
I cannot eate.
To rest then, a ranke of torches there, attend the Prince.
Madam, I doubt I am a guest this night
Too troublesome, and I offend your rest.
This ring speakes for me, that next Collatine you are to me most welcome, 
yet my Lord, thus much presume, without this from his hand, Sextus,
this night could not haue entred here, no, not the king himself, my dores 
the day time to my frinds are frēe, But in the night the obdure gates are lesse kind,
Without this ring they cā no entrāce find.
Lights for the Prince.
A kisse and so godnight, nay for your rings sake deny not that
Ioue giue your Highnes soft and sweet repose.
And thee the like, repose with sweet content,
My vowes are fixt, my thoughts on mischiefe bent.
Tis late, so many starres shine in this roome.
By reason of this great and princely guest,
The world might call our modesty in question,
To reuell thus our husband at the Campe,
Hast and to rest, saue in the Princes chamber,
Let not a light appeare, my hart's all sadnesse,
Ioue vnto thy protection I commit
My chastitie and honour to thy keepe,
My waking soule I giue whilst my thoughts sleepe
Soft, soft, not to loud, imagine we were now going on the ropes with egs at our heeles, 
he that hath but a creeking shooe, I wold he had a creek in his neck, 
tread not too hard for disturbing Prince Sextus.
I wonder the P. would ha none of vs stay in his chamber & helpe him to bed.
What an asse art thou to wonder, there may be many causes 
thou knowest the Prince is a soldier, & soldiers many times want shift, 
who can say whether he haue a cleane shirt on or no?
for any thing that 
we know he hath vsde staues aker a late, or hath tane a medcin to kill the itch, 
whats that to vs, we did our duty to proffer our seruice.
And what should we enter farther into his thoughts?
come, shals to bed?
Ime as drousie as a doremouse, & my head's as heavy as though I had a nightcap of lead on:
And my eies begin to glew themselues together, I was til supper was done altogether
for your repast, and now after supper I am onely for your repose.
I think for the two vertues of eating and sleeping, there's neuer 
a Roman spirit vnder the cope, can put me downe.
For shame what a conjuing and catter-walling keep you heere, 
that my Lady cannot sleepe: you shall haue her call by and by, 
and send you all to bed with a witnes.
Sweete mistris Myrable, we are going.
You are too lowde: come, euerie man dispose him to his rest and ile to mine.
Out with your Torches sir.
Come then, and euerie man sneake into his kennell
Night, be as secret as thou art close, as close
as thou art black and darke, thou ominous Quuene
Of Tenebrous, filence, make this fatall hower,
as true to Rape as thou hast made it kinde
To murder and harsh mischiefe: Cinthea, maske thy cheeke,
And all you sparkling Elamentall fires,
Choke vp your beauties in prodigious fogges,
Or be extinct in some thick vaparous clowde,
Least you beholde my practise: I am bound
Vpon a blacke aduenture, on a deede
That must wound vertue, and make beautie bleede.
Pause Sextus, and before thou runst thy selfe
Into this violent danger, weigh thy sinne,
Thou art yet free, belou'd, grac'd in the Campe,
Of great opinion and vndoubted hope,
Romes darling in the vniuersall grace,
Both of the field, and senate: were these fortunes
To make thee great in both, backe yet, thy fame
Is free from hazard, and thy stile from shame.
Of fate, thou hast vsurpt such power ouer man,
That where thou pleadst thy will, no mortall can.
On then, black mischiefe hurrie me the way.
My selfe I must destroy, her life betray,
The state of King and Subiect, the displeasure
Of Prince and people, the reuenge of noble,
And the contempt of base, the incurd vengeance
Of my wrongd kinsman Colatine, the Treason
A Gainst diuin'st Lucrece: all these total cursses
Foreseene not fearde vppon me Sextus meete,
To make my daies harsh so this might be sweete,
No iarre of clocke, no ominous hatefull howle
Of any starting Hound, no horse rough breath'd from the entrals 
Of any drowsie Groom, wakes this charm'd silence, 
and starts this generall silence forward stil, 
To make thy luste liue, all thy vertues kill.
Heere, heere, beholde!
beneath these Curtaines lyes,
That bright enchantresse that hath daz'd my eies.
Oh, who but Sextus could commit such waste
On one so faire, so kinde, so truely chaste?
Or like a rauisher thus rudely stand,
To offend this face, this brow, this lip, this hand?
Or at such fatall houres, these reuells keepe,
With thought once to defile thy innocent sleepe,
Saue in this brest, such thoughts could finde no place,
Or pay with treason her kind hospitall grace:
But I am lust-burnt, all bent on what's bad,
That which should calme good thoughts makes Tarquin mad.
Madam, Lucresse?
Whose that?
oh me!
beshrew you.
Sweete, tis I.
What I?
Make roome.
My Husband Colatine
Thy husband's at the Campe.
Here is no roome for any man saue him.
Graunt me that grace.
What are you?
Tarquin and thy friend, and must enioy thee.
Heauen such sinnes defend.
Why doe you tremble Lady?
cease this feare,
I am alone, there's no suspitious ear,
That can bewray this deede: nay start not sweete.
Dreame I, or am I full awake?
oh no!
I know I dreame to see Prince Tarquin so.
Sweet Lord awake me, rid me from this terror,
I know you for a Prince, a Gentleman,
Royall and honest, one that loues my Lord,
And would not wrack a womans chastitie,
For Romes imperiall Diademe, oh then
Pardon this dreame, for being awake I know,
Prince Sextus, Romes great hope, would not for shame
Prouoke his owne wrath, or dispoile my fame.
I'me bent on both, my thoughts are all on fire,
Choose thee, thou must imbrace death, or desire,
Yet doe I loue thee, wilt thou accept it?
No.
If not thy loue, thou must inioy thy foe,
where faire meanes cannot, force shall make my way:
By Ioue I must inioy thee.
Sweet Lord stay.
I'me all impatience, violence and rage,
And saue thy bed, nought cā this fire asswage
No, I cannot.
Tell me why?
Hate me, and in that hate first let me dye.
By Joue ile force thee.
By a God you sweare to doe a devils deede: sweete Lord forbear
By the same Ioue I sweare that made this soule,
Neuer to yeelde vnto an act so foule.
Helpe, helpe.
These cushens first shall stop thy breath,
If thou but shreekest: harke how ile frame thy death.
The death: I care not, so I keepe vnstained,
The vnceaz'd honour I haue yet maintaind.
Thou canst keepe neither, for if thou but squeakest,
Or lets the least harsh noise Iarre in my eare,
Ile broach thee on my steele: that done, straite murder
One of thy basest Groomes, and lay you both
Graspt arme in arme, on thy adulterate bed.
Then call in witnes of that mechall sin,
So shalt thou die: thy death be scandalous,
Thy name be odious, thy suspected body
Denide all funerall rites, and louing Colatine
Shall hate thee euen in death: then saue all this,
and to thy fortunes adde another friend,
Giue thy feares comfort, and these torments end.
Ile die first, and yet heare me: oh as y'are noble,
If all your gratious and best generous thoughts
Be not exilde your heart, pittie, oh pittie
The Vertues of a woman: marre not that
Cannot be made againe: this once defilde,
Not all the Ocean waues can purifie,
Or wash my staine away, you seeke to foil
That which the radiant splender of the Sunne
Cannot make bright againe: behold my teares!
Oh thinke them pearled drops, destilled from the heart
Of soule chaste Lucrece: thinke them Orators,
To pleade the cause of absent Colatine, your friend and kinsman.
Tush, I am obdure.
Then make my name foul: keepe my body pure:
Oh Prince of Princes, doe but weigh your sinne,
Thinke how much I shall loose, how small you winne.
I loose the honour of my name and blood,
Lost, Romes imperiall Crowne cannot make good.
You win the worlds shame, & all good mens hate,
Oh who would pleasure, buy at such deere rate?
Nor can you terme it pleasure: for what's sweet,
Where force & hate, iarre and contention meete?
Weigh but for what tis that you vrge me still,
To gaine a womans loue against her will?
Youle but repent such wrong done a chaste wife,
and think that labour's not worth all your strife.
Cursse your hot lust, & say you haue wrongd your friends,
But all the world cannot make me amends.
I tooke you for a friend, wrong not my trust,
But let these chast tearmes quench your fiery lust.
No, those moist teares, contending with my fire,
Quench not my heate, but make it climbe more higher:
Ile drag thee hence.
Oh!
If thou raise these cries, lodg'd in thy flaughtered
arms some base Groome dies,
And Rome that hath thy name admired so long,
Shal blot thy death with scandal from my tungue.
Ioue garde my innocence.
Lucrece, thar't mine
In spight of Ioue & all the powers diuine.
What's a clocke tro?
my Lord bad me be earely ready with his Gelding, 
for he would ride betimes in the morning: now had I rather be vp 
an houre before my time then a minute after, for my Lord will bee so infinitely eangrie 
if I but ouer sleepe my selfe a moment, that I had better bee out of 
my life then in his displeasure: but foft, some of my Lord Colatines 
men lye in the next chamber, I care not if I call them vp, for it growes towards day: 
what Pompy, Pompy.
Who is that cal's?
Tis I.
Whose that, my Lord Sextus his man?
what a poxe make you vp before day?
I would haue the key of the Gate to come at my Lords horse in the stable.
I wold my Lord Sextus & you were both in the hayloft, 
for Pompy can take none of his naturall rest amongst you, heres 
an Ostler, rise & giue my horse another pecke of hay.
Nay good Pompy helpe me to the Key of the stable.
Well, Pompy was borne to doe Rome good, in beeing so kinde to the young Princes Gelding, 
but if for my kindenesse in giuing him Pease and Oates, hee should kick mee, 
I should scarse say god a merrie horse: but come, ile goe with thee to the stable.
Nay, weepe not sweete, what's done is past recall,
Call not thy name in question, by this sorrow
Which yet is without blemish, what hath past
Is hid from the worldes eye, and only priuate
Twixt vs, faire Lucrece, pull not on my head
The wrath of Rome if I haue done thee wrong,
Loue was the cause, thy fame is without blot,
And thou in Sextus hast a true friend got,
Nay sweete looke vp, thou only hast my hart,
I must be gone Lucrece a kisse and part.
Oh!
No?
peuish dame farwell, then be the bruter
Of thy owne shame, which Tarquin would conceale
I am armd against all can come, let mischiefe frown,
With all his terror arm'd with ominous fates,
To all their spleenes a welcome Ile affoord,
With this bold hart, strong hand, and my good sword.
What so early Valer.
and your voyce not vp yet?
thou wast wont to be my Lark and raise me with thy early notes.
I was neuer so hard set yet my Lord, but I had euer a fit of mirth for my friend.
Prethee let's heare it then whilst we may, 
for I deuine thy musique and my madnes are both short liu'd, 
we shall haue somewhat else to doe ere long, we hope Valerius.
Ioue send it.
Me thinks our warres goe not wel forward,
Horatius, we haue greater Enimies to bustle with then the
Ardeans if we durst but front them Horatius.
Would it were come to fronting.
Then we married men should haue the aduantage of the batchelers Horatius, 
especially such as haue reuelling wiues, those that can caper in the Citty, 
while their husbands are in the Camp, Collat why are you so sad?
the thought of this shold not trouble you, hauing a Luc.
to your bedfellow.
My Lord I know no cause of discontent, yet can not I be merry.
I should be frolique if my brother were but returnd to the Camp, 
and in good time behould Prince Sextus.
Health to our generall.
Thank you.
Wil you suruey your forces, & giue order for a present assault, 
your soldiers long to be tugging with the Ardeās.
No.
Haue you seene Lucretia my Lord, how fares shee?
Well, Ile to my Tent.
Why how now whats the matter brother?
Thank you, No, well, Ile to my Tent, get thee to thy Tent & a coward goe with thee, 
if thou hast no more spirit to a speedy encounter.
Shall I goe after him and know the cause of his discontent?
Or I my Lord?
Neither, to pursue a foole in his humour?
is the next way to make him more humerous, 
Ile not be guiltie of his folly, Thank you!
no, before I wish him health agen when he is sicke of the sullens, may I dye, 
not like a Roman, bu a runagate.
Perhaps hee's not well.
Well, then let him be ill.
The news with this hasty poast?
Did nobody see my Lord Colatine?
oh, my Lady commends her to you, heer's a letter.
Giue it me.
Fye vppon't, neuer was poore Pompy so ouer-labourde as I haue bin, 
I thinke I haue spurd my horse such a question, 
that hee's scarce able to wig or wag his taile for an answere, 
but my Lady bad me spare for no horse flesh, and I think I haue made him run his race.
Cosen Colatine the news at Rome?
Nothing but what you all may well pertak: read here my Lord.
Deere Lord, if euer thou wilt see thy Lucrece,
Choose of the friends which thou affectest best,
And all important busines set apart,
Repaire to Rome: commend me to Lord Brutus,
Valerius Mutius, & Horatius,
Say I intreat their presence, where my Father
Lucretius shall attend them, farwell sweete,
Th' affaires are great, then doe not faile to meete.
Ile thither as I liue,
I though I dye,
To Roome with expeditious wings weel'e fly.
The news, the newes, if it haue any shape
Of sadnes, if some prodegye haue chanst,
That may beget reuenge, Ile cease to chafe,
Vexe, martyr, grieue, torture, torment my selfe,
And tune my humour to strange strains of mirth:
My soule deuines some happinesse, speak, speak:
I know thou hast some newes that will create me
Merry and musical, for I would laugh,
Be new transhapt, I prethee sing Valerius that I may ayre
with thee.
First tell vs what's the proiect of thy massage?
My Lords, the princely Sextus has bene at home, but what he hath done, 
I may partly mistrust, but cannot altogether resolue you: besides, my Lady swore me, 
that whatsoeuer I suspected I should say nothing.
If thou wilt not say thy minde, I prethee sing thy minde, and then thou maist saue thine oath.
Indeede I was not sworn to that, I may either laugh out my newes or sing am, 
and so saue my oath to my Lady.
Howe's all at Rome, that with such sad presage,
Disturbed Colatine, and noble Brutus
Are hurryed from the Campe with Scevola?
And we with expedition amongst the rest,
Are charg'd to Rome?

Madam.
Is not my father old Lucrecius come yet?
Not yet.
Nor any from the Campe?
Neither madam.
Go, be gone, and leaue me to the truest grief of heart
That euer entred any Matrons brest.
Oh!
Why weepe you Lady?
alas why doe you staine
Your modest cheekes with these offensiue teares?
Nothing, nay nothing: oh you powerfull Gods,
That should haue Angels guardent on your throne,
To protect innocence and chastitie!
oh why Suffer you such inhumane massacre
On harmeles vertue?
wherefore take you charge,
On sinles soules to see them wounded thus:
With Rape or Violence?
forgiue white innocence,
Armor of proofe gainst sinne: or by oppression
Kill Vertue quite, & guerdon base transgression?
Is it my fate aboue all other women?
Or is my sinne more haynous then the rest,
That amongst thousands, millions, infinites,
I, only I, should to this shame be borne,
To be a staine to women, natures scorne?
oh!
What ailes you Madam, troth you make me weepe
To see you shead salt teares: what hath opprest you?
Why is your chamber hung with mourning blacke?
Your habit sable, and your eyes thus swolne
With ominous teares: alas what troubles you?
I am not, thou didst deceiue thy felfe,
I did not weepe, theres nothing troubles me,
But wherefore dost thou blush?
Madam not I.
Indeede thou didst, and in that blush my guilt thou didst betray
How cam'st thou by the notice of my sinne?
What sinne?
My blot, my scandall and my shame:
Oh Tarquin!
thou my honour didst betray,
Disgrace no time, no age can wipe away, oh!
Sweete Lady cheere your selfe, ile fetch my Vyol
And see if I can sing you fast a sleepe,
A little rest would weare away this passion.
Doe what thou wilt, I can commaund no more,
Being no more a woman, I am now
Deuote to death, and an inhabitant
Of th'other world: these eyes must euer weepe,
Till fate hath closde them with eternall sleepe.
Brutus!
Lucretius!
Father!
Lucrece!
Collatine!
How cheare you Madam?
how ist with you cousen?
Why is your eye deiect and drown'd in sorrow?
Why is this funerall black, and ornaments
Of widdow-hood?
resolue me cousen Lucrece.
How fare you Lady?
What's the matter girle?
Why how i'st with you Lucrece, tell me sweete?
Why doost thou hide thy face?
& with thy hand
Darken those eies that were my Sunnes of joy,
To make my pleasures florish in the Spring?
Oh me!
Whence are these sighes and teares?
How growes this passion?
Speake Lady you are hem'd in with your friendes,
Girt in a pale of safety, and environ'd
and cirkled in a fortresse of your kinred,
Let not those drops fall fruiteles to the ground,
Nor let your sighes ad to the sencelesse winde.
Speake, who hath wrong you?
Ere I speake my woe,
Sweare youle reuenge poore Lucrece on her foe.
Be his head archt with golde.
Be his hand arm'd with an imperiall Scepter.
Be he great as Tarquin throand in an imperial seat
Be he no more then mortall, he shall feele
The vengefull edge of this victorious steele.
Then seate you Lords, whilst I expose my wrong.
Father, deere husband, and my kinsmen, Lords
Heare me, I am dishonour'd and disgrac'd,
My reputation mangled, my renown
disparaged, but my body, oh my body
What Lucrece?
Staind, polluted and defilde.
Strange steps are found in my adulterate bed,
And though my thoughts be white as innocence,
Yet is my body soild with lust burnd sinne,
And by a stranger I am strumpited,
Rauisht, inforc'd, and am no more to ranke among the Roman Matrons.
Yet cheere you Lady, and restraine these teares,
If you were forc'd, the sinne concernes not you,
A woman's born but with a womans strength: who was the Rauisher?
I, name him Lady, our loue to you shal only thus appeare
In the reuenge that we will take on him.
I hope so Lords, t'was Sextus the Kings Sonne.
How?
Sextus Tarquin!
That vnprincely Prince, who guest-wise entred with my husbands Ring,
This Ring, oh Collatine!
this Ring you sent
Is cause of all my woe, your discontent.
I feasted him, then lodgd him, and bestowde
The choisest welcome, but in dead of night,
My Traiterous guest came arm'd vnto my bed,
Frighted my silent sleepe, threatend, and praide
For entertainment: I despised both.
Which hearing his sharpe pointed Semitar,
The Tyrant bent against my naked brest,
Alas, I begd my death, but note his tyranny,
He brought with him a torment worse then death
For hauing murdred me, he swore to kill,
One of my basest Groomes and lodge him dead
In my dead armes: then call in testimony
Of my adulterie, to make me hated
Euen in my death, of husband, father, friendes,
Of Rome and all the world: this, this, oh Princes, Rauisht and kild me at once.
Yet comfort Lady, I quit thy guilt, for what could
Lucrece doe more then a woman?
hadst thou dide polluted
By this base scandall, thou hadst wrong'd thy fame,
And hinderd vs of a moste iust reuenge.
What shall we doe Lords?
Lay your resolute handes vpon the sword of Brutus,
Vow & sweare, as you hope meed for merrit from the Gods
Or feare reward for sinne, from deuils below:
As you are Romans, and esteeme your fame
More then your liues, all humorous toyes set off,
Of madding, singing, smilings, and what else,
Receiue your natiue vallours, be your selues,
And ioyne with Brutus in the iust reuenge
Of this chaste rauisht Lady, sweare
We doe.
Then with your humors heere my griefe ends too,
My staine I thus wipe off, call in my sighes,
and in the hope of this reuenge, forbeare
Euen to my death to fall one passionate teare.
Yet Lords, that you may crowne my innocence,
With your best thoughts, that you may henceforth know,
We are the same in heart we seeme in show.
and though I quit my soule of all such sin, 
Ile not debarre my body punishment:
Let all the world, learne of a Roman dame,
To prise her life lesse then her honord fame.
Lucrece?
Wife.
Lady.
She hath slaine herselfe.
Oh see yet Lords if there be hope of life
Shees dead, then turne your funerall teares to fire and indignation, 
let vs now redeeme Our misspent time, and ouer take our sloath With hostile expedition, 
this great Lords, This bloody knife, on which her chast blood flower, 
Shall not from Brutus till some strange reuenge fall on the heads of Tarquins.
Nowe's the time to call their pride to compt,
Brutus leade on, Weele follow thee to their confusion.
By Jove we will, the sprightfull youth of Rome,
Trickt vp in plumed harnesse, shall attend
The march of Brutus, whome wee here create our genrall against the Tarquins.
Bee it so.
We imbrace it: now to stir the wrath of Rome,
You, Collatine and good Lucretius,
With eyes yet drown'd in teares, beare that chaste body
Into the market place: that horrid obiect,
Shall kindle them with a most iust reuenge.
To see the father and the husband mourne
Ore this chaste dame, that haue so well deseru'd
Of Rome and them, then to infer the pride,
The wrongs and the perpetuall tyranny
Of all the Tarquins, Servius Tullius death,
and his vnnaturall vsage by that Monster
Tullia the Queene, all these shall well concurre in a combind reuenge
Lucrece, thy death weele mourne in glittering armes
and plumed caskes: some beare that reuerend loade,
Vnto the forum where our force shall meete
To set vppon the pallas, and expell
This viperous broode from Rome: I know the people
Will gladly imbrace our fortunes: Sceuola,
Goe you and muster powers in Brutus name.
Valerius, you assist him instantly,
and to the mazed people freely speake the cause of this concourse
We goe.
And you deare Lord, whose speechles greef is boundles,
Turne all your teares with ours, to wrath and rage,
The hearts of all the Tarquins shall weep blood
Vpon the funerall Hearse, with whose chaste body,
Honor your armes, and to th'assembled people,
Disclose her innocent woundes: Gramercies Lords,
That vniuersall shout tels me their words
are gratious with the people, and their troopes
are ready imbatteled and expect but vs,
To leade their troopes, Ioue giue our fortunes speede,
Weele murder, murder, and base rape shall bleede.
Euen thus farre Tirant haue we dogd thy stepes,
Frighting thy frighted feare with horrid steele.
Lodge in the safety of Porsennaes armes
Now Traytor Brutas we dare front thy pride.
Porsenna thou art vnworthy of a scepter,
To shelter pride, lust, rape, and tiranny,
In that proud Prince and his confederate sonnes.
Traytors to heauen, to Tarquin, Roome and vs,
Treason to Kings, doth stretch euen to the Gods,
And those high Gods that take great Rome in charge,
shall punish your rebellion.
Oh Deuil!
Sextus speake not thou of Gods,
Not cast those false and fained eyes to heauen,
Whose rape the furies must torment in Hell, of Lucr: Lucrect:
Her chast blood still cries for vengeance to the Etheriall deities
Oh twa's a foule deede Sextus,
And thy shame shal be eternall, and outlive her fame
Say Sextus lou'd her, was she not a woman,
I, and perhaps was willing to beforc'd,
Must you being priuate subiects dare to ring
Warres loud alarum gainst your potent King?
Brutus therein thou dost forget thy selfe, And wrongst the glory of thine 
Ancestors, stayning thy bloud with Treason.
Tuscan know the Consull Brutus is their powerfull foe.
Consull
I consull, and the powerfull hand of Rome
Graspes his imperiall sword: the name of King
The tirant Tarquins haue made odious
Vnto this nation: and the generall knee,
Of this our warlik people, now lowe bends
To royall Brutus where the kings name endes.
Now Sextus, where's the Oracle, when I kissed
My Mother earth it plainely did foretell,
My noble vertues should thy sin exceed,
Brutus should sway, & lust-burnt Tarquin bleed
Now shall the blood of Seruius fall, as heauy as a huge mountaine 
on your Tyrant heads, orewhelming all your glory.
Tullias guilt shall be by vs reuengd, that in her pride,
In blood paternal, her rough coach-wheeles dide.
Your Tirannies,
Pride.
And my Lucrece fate, shall al be swalowd in this hostile hate.
Oh Romulus, thou that fiirst reard yon walles,
In sight of which we stand, in thy soft bosome
Is hangd the nest in which the Tarquins build,
Which in the branches of thy lofty spires,
Tarquin shal pearch, or where he once hath stood,
His high built airy shall be drownd in blood,
alarum then, Brutus by heauen I vow,
My sword shall prooue thou nere wast mad till now.
Sextus, my madnes with your liues expires,
Thy sensuall eyes are fixt vpon that wall,
Thou nere shalt enter, Rome confines you all.
A charge then.
Ioue and Tarquin.
but we cry a Brutus.
Lucrece, force and victory.
Thou Iouiall hand hould vp thy scepter high
And let not iustice be oprest with pride,
Oh you Senators, leaue not Roome and vs,
Graspt in the purple hands of death and ruine, the Tarquins haue the best.
Yet stand, my foote is fixt vpon this bridge.
Tyber, thy arched streames shall be changd crimso, with
Roman bloud, before I trudge form hence.
Brutus retire, for if thou enter Rome,
We are all lost, stand not on valor now,
But saue thy people, lets suruiue this day
To try the fortunes of another field.
Breake downe the bridge, lest the pursuing enemy Enter with vs and take the spoile of Rome.
Then breake behind me, for by heauen Ile grow,
And roote my foote as deepe as to the center, before I leaue this passage.
Come you'r mad.
The foe comes on and we in trifling here hazard our selfe and people.
Saue them all, to make Rome stand, Horatius here will fall.
We would not lose thee, do not brest thy selfe
Mongst thousands, if thou frontst them thou art ringde,
With million swords and darts, and we behind
Must breake the bridge of Tiber to saue Rome,
Before thee infinits gase on thy face,
And menace death, the raging streames of Tiber are at thy backe to swallow thee.
Retire to make Rome liue, tis death that I desire.
Then farewell dead Horatius, thinke in vs
The vniuersall arme of potent Rome,
Takes his last leaue of thee in this embrace.
Farwell.
Farwell.
These arches all must downe to interdict their passage the towne.
Enter, enter, enter.
Soft Tarquin, see a bulwarke to this bridge.
You first must passe, the man that enters here
Must make his passage through Horatius brest,
See with this target do I buckle Rome,
And with this sword defy the puissant army of two great king.
One man to face an host,
Charge souldiers, of full forty thousan Romans,
Theres but one daring hand against your host,
To keep you from the sacke or spoile of Rome, charge, charge.
Vpon them Souldiers!
Oh cowards, slaues, and vassals what not enter?
Was it for this you plac'd my regiment
Vpon a hill, to be the sad spectator
Of such a generall cowardise?
Tarquin, Aruns,
Porsenna, souldiers, passe Horatius quickly,
And they behind him will deuolue the bridge
And raging Tyber that's impassible,
Your host must swim before you conquer Rome.
Yet stand Horatius, beare but one brunt more,
The arched bridge shall sinke vpon his piles
And in his fall lift vp thy renown to heauen
Yet enter.
Deare Horatius, yet stand, & saue a milliō by one powerful hand
Charge charge, charge.
Degenerate slaues, the bridge is falne, Romes lost.
Horatius thou art stronger then their Hostes,
Thy strength is vertue, theirs are idle boastes.
Now saue thy selfe and leap into the waues.
Porsenna, Tarquin, now wade past your depths,
And enter Rome, I feele my body sinke
Beneath my pondrous waight, Rome is preseru'd,
And now farewell: for he that followes me
Must search the bottome of this raging stream,
Fame with thy golden wings, renowne my crest,
And Tiber take me on thy siluer brest.
Hee's leapt off from the bridge and drownd himselfe.
You are deceiu'd, his spirits soares too hie
To be choakt in with the base element
Of water, lo he swims armd as he was,
Whilest all the army haue dischargd their arrowes.
Of which the shield vpon his backe sticke ful.
And harke the sute of all the multitude.
Now welcomes him a land, Horatius fame
Hath chekt our armies with a generall shame;
But come, to morrowes fortune must restore,
This scandall, which I of the Gods implore
Then we must find another time faire prince,
To scourge these people, and reuenge your wrongs.
For this night ile betake me to my tent
And we to ours, to morrowe we will renowne
Our army with the spoile of a Rich-towne.
Our secretary.
My Lord.
Command lights and torches in our tents.
And let a Guard ingirt our safety rownd,
Whilest we debate of military busines: come sit and lets consult.
Horatius, famous for defending Rome.
But we ha done nought worthy, Scevola,
Nor of a Roman, I in this disguise
Haue past the army & the puissant guard
Of king Porsenna; this should be his tent
And in good time, now fate direct my strength
Against a king to free great Rome at length.
Oh I am slaine, treason, treason.
Villaine what hast thou done?
Why slaine the king.
What king?
Porsenna.
Porsenna liues to see thee tortured,
With plagues more diuillish then the plague of hel.
Oh too rash Mutius, hast thou mist thy aime?
And thou base hand that didst direct my poniard
Against a peasants brest, behold thy errour,
Thus I will punish, I will giue thee freely
Vnto the fire, nor will I weare a limbe,
That with such rashness shall offend his Lord.
What wil the madman doe?
Porsenna so punish my hand thus, for not killing thee.
Three hundred noble lads beside my selfe
Haue vow'd to all the Gods that patron Rome,
Thy ruine for supporting tyrannie;
And though I faile, expect yet euerie houre,
When some strange fate thy fortunes wil deuoure.
Stay Roman, we admire thy constancie,
And scorne of fortune, go returne to Rome,
We giue thee life, and say the King Porsenna,
Whose life thou seekst is this honourable,
Passe freely, gard him to the walles of Rome,
And were we not so much ingadge to Tarquin,
We would not lift a hand against that nation that breedes such noble spirits.
Well I go, and for reuenge take life euen of my foe.
Conduct him safely, what 300 Gallants
Sworne to our death, and all resolu'd like him!
We must be prouident, to morrowes fortune
Weele proue for Tarquin, if they faile our hopes,
Peace shal be made with Rome, but first our secretary,
Shall haue his due rights of funerall, then our shield
We must addresse next for to morrowes field.
By thee we are consul, & stil gouerne Rome,
Which but for thee, had bin dispoild and tane,
Made a confused heape of men and stones,
Swimming in bloud and slaughter, dere Horatius
Thy noble picture shal be caru'd in brasse,
And fixt for thy perpetuall memory in our high capitoll.
Great consul thankes, but leauing this, lets march out of the citie.
And once more bid them battell on the plaines.
This day my soule diuines we shal liue free
From all the furious Tarquins: but wheres Scevola?
we se not him to day.
Here Lords behold me handlesse as you see,
The cause I mist Porsonna in his tent,
And in his stead kild but his secretary.
The mazed King when he beheld me punish
My rash mistake, with losse of my right hand
Vnbegd and almost scornd he gaue me life,
Which I had then refus'd, but in desire to venge faire Lucrece Rape.
Deare Scevola thou hast exceeded vs in our resolue,
But wil the Tarquins giue vs present battell?
That may ye heare, the skirmish is begun already twixt the horse.
Then noble consull leade our main battell on.
Oh Ioue this day ballance our cause, and let the innocēt bloud
Of Rape staind Lucrece crowne with death and horror
The heads of all the Tarquins, see this day
In her cause do we consecrate our liues,
And in defence of Iustice now march on:
I heare their martiall musique, be our shock
As terrible as are the meeting clowdes
That breake in thunder, yet our hopes are faire,
And this rough charge shal all our hopes repaire.
Yet grow our lofty plumes vnflagd with bloud,
And yet sweet pleasure wantons in the aire, how goes the battell Aruns?
Tis euen ballanct, I enterchang'd with Brutus hand to hand, 
a dangerous encounter both are wounded, & had not the rude prease diuided vs, 
one had dropt downe to earth.
Twas brauely fought, I saw the King your father free his person from thousand 
Romans that begirt his state, where flying arrowes thick as atoms hung about his eares.
I hope a glorious day, come Tuskan king, lets on them.
Aruns stay, that sword that late did drinke the consuls bloud
Must with his keene phange tire vpon my flesh, or this on thine.
It sparde the consuls life to end thy daies in a more glorious strife.
I stand against thee Tuscan.
I for thee.
Where ere I find a Tarquin, hees for me.
Faire Tullia leaue me, saue thy life by flight,
Since mine is desperate, behold I am wounded
Euen to the death, there staies within my tent
A winged Iennet, mount his back and fly,
Liue to reuenge my death since I must dy.
Had I the heart to treade vpon the bulke
Of my dead father, and to see him slaughtered,
Only for loue of Tarquin and a crowne,
And shall I feare death more then losse of both?
No, this is Tulliaes fame, rather then fly
From Tarquin, mongst a thousand swords sheel dy.
Hew them to peeces both.
My Tullia saue, and ore my caitiue head those meteors waue.
Let Tullia yeeld then.
Yeeld me cuckold no mercy, I scorne, let me the danger know.
Vpon them then.
Lets bring them to their fate,
And let them perish in the peoples hate.
Feare not, Ile back thee husband.
But for thee, sweet were the hand that this chargd soule could free.
Life I diepise, let noble Sextus stand
To auenge our death, euen til these vitals end,
Scorning my owne, this life will I defend.
And Ile sweete Tarquin to my power gard thine,
Come on you slaues and make this earth diuine.
Aruns this crimson fauor for thy sake,
Ile weare vpon my forehead maskt with bloud
Till all the moistures in the Tarquins veines
Be spilt vpon the earth and leaue thy body
As dry as the parcht sommer, burnt and scorcht with the canicular starres.
Aruns lies dead by this bright sword thats here about his head.
And see great consull, where the pride of Rome lies sunke and fallen.
Besides him lies the queene mangled and hewd amongst the Roman soldièrs.
Lift vp their slaughtered bodies, help to reare them against this hill in view of all the camp, 
This sight wil be a terror to the foe, and make them yield or fly.
But wheres the rauisher, iniurious Sextus that we see not him?
Through broken speares, crackt swords, vnboweld steedes
Flaude armors, mangled limbes, and battered caskes,
Knee deepe in bloud, I ha pierct the Roman host to be my fathers rescue.
Tis too late, his mounting prid's sunke in the peoples hate.
My father, mother, brother, fortune now,
I do defy thee, I expose my selfe,
To horrid danger, saftie I despise,
I dare the worst of perill, I am bound,
On till this pile of flesh be all one wound,
Begirt him Lord, this is the Rauisher.
Theres no reuenge for Lucrece til he fall.
Cease Sextus then.
Sextus defies you all, yet wil you giue me language ere I die:
Say on.
Tis not for mercy, for I scorne that life
Thats giuen by any, and the more to ad
To your immense vnmeasurable hate,
I was the spur vnto my fathers pride,
Twas I that awde the Princes of the Land,
That made thee Brutus mad, these discontents,
I rauisht the chaste Lucrece, Sextus I,
The daughter and thy wife, Brutus thy cosen.
Allide indeed to all, twas for my Rape,
Her constant hand ript vp her innocent brest, twas Sextus did all this.
Which ile reuenge.
Leaue that to me.
Old as I am ile do't.
I haue one hand yet left, of strength inough to kill a rauisher.
Come all at once, I all: yet heare me Brutus, thou art Honorable.
And my words tend to thee: my father dide
By many hands, whats he mongst you can challenge
The least, I smallest honor in his death?
If I be kild amongst this hostile throng
The poorest snakie souldier well may claime
As much renowne in royall Sextus death,
As Brutus, thou, or thou Horatius.
I am to die, and more then die I cannot,
Rob not your selues of Honor in my death.
When the two mightiest spirits of Greece and Troy
Tugde for the masterie, Hector and Achilles,
Had puissant Hector by Achilles hand,
Dide in a single monomachie Achilles,
Had been the worthie, but being slaine by odds,
The poorest Mirmidon had as much honor
As saint Achilles in the Troians death.
Hadst thou not done a deed so execrable,
That Gods and men abhorre, ide loue thee Sextus,
And hugge thee for this chalēge breath'd so freely:
Behold, I stand for Rome as Generall,
Thou of the Tarquins dost alone suruiue,
The head of all these garboyles the chife actor
Of that blacke sinne which we chastise by armes.
Brave Romans, with your bright swords be our lists
And ring vs in, none dare to offend the Prince
By the least touch, lest he incurre our wrath:
This honor do your Consull, that his hand
may punish this arch mischiefe, that the times
Succeeding may of Brutus thus much tell,
By him pride, lust, and all the Tarquins fell.
To rauish Lucrece, cuckold Collatine:
And spill the chasest bloud that euer ran,
In any matrons vaines, repents me not
So much as to ha wrong'd a gentleman
So noble as the Consul in this strife.
Brutus be bold, thou fightst with one scornes life.
And thou with one that lesse then his renowne,
Priseth his bloud, or Romes imperiall crowne
Sextus stand faire, much honour shall I winn
To reuenge Lucrece, and chastise thy sin.
I repent nothing, may I liue or die,
Though my bloud fall, my spirit shall mount on hie.
Both slaine: oh noble Brutus this thy fame
To after ages shall suruiue, thy body
Shall haue a faire & gorgious Sepulchre:
For whom the matrons shall in funeral black
Mourne twelue sad moones, thou that first gouern'd Rome,
And swaid the people by a consuls name.
These bodies of the Tarquins weele commit
Vnto the funerall pile: you Collatine
Shall succeed Brutus, in the consuls place.
Whom with this Lawrel wreath we here relate.
Such is the peoples voice, accept it then.
We do, and may our power so iust appeare
Rome may haue peace, both with our loue & feare.
But soft, what march is this?
The Tuscan king, seeing the Tarquins slaine.
Thus arm'd and battelled offers peace to Rome.
To confirme which, we'le giue you present hostage
If you deny, we'le stand vpon our guard,
And by the force of armes, maintaine our owne
After so much effusion and large wast
Of Roman bloud the name of peace is welcome,
Since of the Tarquins none remaine in Rome.
And Lucrece's rape is now reueng'd at full.
Twere good to entertaine Porsenna's league.
Porsenna we embrace, whose royall presence
Shall grace the Consull to the funerall pile.
March on to Rome, Ioue be our guard and guide,
That hath in vs veng'd Rape and punisht pride.
